<h1>Animals</h1>
<p>Animals. And parts of animals of almost every species, are now to be met within armorial bearings. </p>
<p>In blazoning the teetli, or claws of Lions,Tigers, Wolves and all ravenous beasts, are called their arms ; and when of a different tincture to the body must be named, and the animals are said to be armed of such a colour. This term "Armed" also applies to the horns of Bulls, Goats, &amp;c. The tongue of all beasts, if not mentioned is to be gules ; except the animal itself is gules, then it must be azure ; and when the tongue has to be named, the animal is said to be "langued" e.g. a Lion gu., armed and langued az. But in blazoning Deer, altho' their horns are their weapons, they are said to be " Attired," and when the hoof of the Deer, Horse, Bull, Goat, etc., is of a different tincture it is termed " Unguled." See these Terms.  </p>
