<h1>Arms Dimidiated</h1>
<p>Arms Dimidiated. It was an ancient custom when impaling arms, to cut off a portion of either coat so impaled ; but this being liable to cause great confusion, in fact entirely to destroy the bearing, it has long since ceased to be used in English Heraldry, except in the case of a coat with a bordure, when the bordure is always dimidiated. <a href="../plate13.html">P.  13,</a>  f. 43. </p>
<p>The arms of the Borough of Gt. YarmouthCo. Nor. are Dimidiated. See <a href="../plate22.html">P.  22,</a>  f. 18.  </p>
