If a Peeress in her own right, the husband bear her arms in an escutcheon of pretence, and also places her arms by the side of his own, as shown at <a href="../plate20.html">P.  20,</a>  f. 21. </p>
<p>If the lady becomes a widow, she bears herown arms as above, and those of her husband, with her own, in a lozenge, omitting the crest.  </p>
