<h1>Arms of Pretention</h1>
<p>Arms of Pretention. Are those borne by Sovereigns, who, although they have not possession of certain dominions, claim a right to them. Thus the Sovereigns of England quartered the arms of France from the year 1330 when Edw. iii. laid claim to that kingdom, till the year 1801, although long before this England had laid aside all pretensions to France. <a href="../plate31.html">P.  31,</a>  f. 4 to 9.  </p>
