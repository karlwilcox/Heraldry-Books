<h1>Augmentations</h1>
<p>Augmentations. Are particular marks of honour. </p>
<p>Granted by the Sovereign as additions to thepaternal arms ; and for the most part are borne upon a Canton, or Inescutcheon, sometimes upon a Chief, and Fesse ; and may be derived from acts of valour, or loyalty ; from profession ; or from any memorable circumstances and events, eg. The arms of the Duke of Wellington contain the following Augmentation viz. On the honour-point an escutcheon, charged with the Crosses of St. Geoi'ge, St. Andrew, and St. Patrick, conjoined, being the union badge of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Now this badge being the common device of our united opinions, shews that we think the Duke of Wellington was entitled to the highest honours which a united people would desire to confer on the chief defender of their country. <a href="../plate21.html">P.  21,</a>  f. 21. The Augmentation granted to the Duke of Marlborough " in chief an esciitcheon ar. charged with the cross of St. George gu. and thereon an escutcheon of the Arms of France."
