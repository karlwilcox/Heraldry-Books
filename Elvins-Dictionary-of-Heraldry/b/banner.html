<p>It is a square flag, and on it are exhibitedthe owner's arms ; gentlemen have a right to display their banners on their mansions, but the common practice, when they exhibit any banner, is to hoist the Union-Jack, which might with quite as much propriety be painted on their carriages. See Ensign, Flag and Standard. Banner of the Commonwealth. <a href="../plate31.html">P.  31,</a>  f. 29.  </p>
