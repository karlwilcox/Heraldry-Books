<h1>Baronet</h1>
<p>Baronet. The lowest degree of hereditary dignity ; rank among themselves according to creation, and follow next to the younger sons of barons, taking precedence of all Knights, except of the Garter. </p>
<p>The order was originally instituted by KingJames 1. in 1611 for the colonization of Ulster, and the Arms of that province were deemed the most appropriate insignia. They are placed on a canton or in an escutcheon on the jiaternal coat, in the most convenient spot. When the Shield contains many quarterings, it should be borne in the paternal coat, and not as is frequently the case upon the intersection, or partition of the shield. This does not apply where the Baronet has two surnames, bearing arms for each quarterly ; then it ought to be placed on the centre division of the four quarterings. Arms of a Baronet, <a href="../plate14.html">P.  14,</a>  f . 21, and <a href="../plate23.html">P.  23,</a>  f . 21 .  </p>
