<h1>Birds</h1>
<p>Birds. Of various kinds are met with in armorial bearings. See <a href="../plate33.html">P.  33</a>  and 34. </p>
<p>In blazon, birds of prey whose weapons aretheir beak and talons, are blazoned armed of such a tincture. But such birds as Swans, Ducks, Herons, etc., who have no talons, in blazoning are said to be beaked and membered, which last term signifies the legs ; and when the wings of a bird are of a different tincture from the body, it is said to be winged of such a tincture. When "Bird" is mentioned in blazon without naming the particular class of bird it is always drawn as <a href="../plate34.html">P.  34,</a>  f. 43.  </p>
