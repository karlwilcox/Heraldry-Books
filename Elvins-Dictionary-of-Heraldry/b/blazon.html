<h1>Blazon</h1>
<p>Blazon, or Blason. A term generally applied to the knowledge and description of armorial bearings according to the rules of Heraldry. </p>
<p>In blazoning a Coat of Arms, i.e. describingit, the Field is always first mentioned noticing the lines wherewith it is divided, and the difEerences of these linos, whether they be straight or crooked. Then proceed to the charge nearest the centre, and name those charges last which are furthest from the field, i.e. the charges upon the Ordinaries. The principal Ordinary in the coat (with the oxccption of the Chief) must be named next to the field, e.g. <a href="../plate2.html">P.  2,</a>  f. 45. If the Ordinary itself is charged, such charge to be blazoned next to those between which the Ordinary is placed, e.g. <a href="../plate2.html">P.  2.</a>  f. 3, and <a href="../plate22.html">P.  22,</a>  f. 33. If there is no Ordinary in the arms the central charge is to be first named after the field, then the charge, if any, on the central charge, then the Border; nest the Chief or Canton with its charges, e.g. <a href="../plate13.html">P.  13,</a>  f. 40., &amp; <a href="../plate22.html">P.  22,</a>  f. 32. When a bearing is described without naming the point of the Escutcheon where it is to be placed, the centre is always understood ; the same is also observed in respect to the charges upon Ordinaries, or one charge upon another. <a href="../plate20.html">P.  20,</a>  f . 42. When there are three charges with or without Ordinary they are borne two in chief and one in base, <a href="../plate22.html">P.  22,</a>  f. 43 ; but if they are not so placed, or, exceed three, their position must be named, see <a href="../plate4.html">P.  4,</a>  f. 31., <a href="../plate22.html">P.  22,</a>  f. 15 and Is. In Blazoning a coat, repetition of the same word must be avoided, as for example, it would be incorrect to describe the following coat thus ; Sa. on a fesse ar. betw. three lions; heads erased ar. three mullets sa. It should be sa. on a fesse betw. three lions' heads erased ar. "as many" mullets " of the first," or "of the field" Of the first, or of the field, is used to prevent repetition of sa. The following rule is now observed by the Heralds, never to place colour on colour, or metal upon metal ; and although a few instances of departure from this rule might be produced in some very ancient coats, ( Carson, Bissett, Lloyd, White, etc.) yet these exceptions do not destroy the rule. </p>
<p>In Blazoning roundles, or guttee drops, youare not to say a roundle or guttee of such a tincture (unless it be party coloured or counterchanged) for their names vary according to the different tinctures of which they are composed ; so that a roundle which is of Gold, is not blazoned a roundle or., but a Bezant, and a guttle drop red, is not to be blazoned a gutto gu., but guttee de sang. When roundles and guttee are borne upon a party coloured field and are of the alternate tinctures, they are blazoned roundles or guttoe counterchanged, e 6. Quarterly ar. and sa. six roundles 3, 2, and 1, counterchanged. <a href="../plate2.html">P.  2,</a>  f . 39. A high bonnet, or cap, per pale sa. and ar., banded gu., the cap guttee counterchanged. <a href="../plate40.html">P.  40,</a>  f. 50. In Blazoning animals, a distinction must be particularly observed as to the kind of animal to which the terra is to be applied, e 6. The terms Rampant, Saliant, Passant, Couchant, are properly applied to Lions, Tigers, etc. But for Deer the same attitudes are expressed, the first two by the term Springing, the other two by the terms Tripping, and Lodged ; and a Lion standing full-faced is termed Guardant, but a Stag would be termed at Gaze. <a href="../plate2.html">P.  2</a> G and <a href="../plate28.html">P.  28.</a>  Respecting the blazoning of Men, Animals, Birds, Fish, Trees, etc. see each under its respective term. </p>
<p>After Blazoning the Shield, you proceed tothe exterior ornaments viz. : The Helmet, Lambrequin, Crest, Supporters, Badge, and Motto, e.g. <a href="../plate8.html">P.  8,</a>  f. 21 ; <a href="../plate18.html">P.  18,</a>  f. 21.  </p>
