<h1>Castle</h1>
<p>Castle. The emblem of safety. Castles are of different forms in armoury, when mentioned as Castles are always borne as at <a href="../plate23.html">P.  23,</a>  f. 7. </p>
<p>If the cement is of a different tincture fromthe Castle itself, it must be named, and the castle is said to be masoned of such a tincture. The Windows and Ports, when of a different colour, must be expressed ; when supposed to be open, they should be described " voided of the field." When the port is defended by a portcullis it must be named in the blazon. Examples of Castles. See <a href="../plate23.html">P.  23.</a>   </p>
