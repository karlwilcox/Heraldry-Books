<h1>Distinction of Houses</h1>
<p>Distinction of Houses, Differences, Brizures, or Marks of Cadency. Are used to distinguish the younger from the elder branches of a family, and to show from what line each is descended. </p>
<p>Thus in Modern Heraldry the Eldest son.during his Father's lifetime, bears a Label, the second a Crescent, the third a Mullet, the fourth a Martlet, etc. See <a href="../plate46.html">P.  46.</a>  </p>
<p>These distinctions are placed in the shield atthe middle chief, or in a quarterly coat at the fess point. See term Cadency. </p>
<p>In the case of the Royal Family, eachmember bears the Label, extending across the shield ; the points of which are variously charged, and are borne on the crest and supporters. <a href="../plate19.html">P.  19.</a>  f. 40 to 45, and <a href="../plate25a.html">P.  25a,</a>  f. 1 and 2.  </p>
