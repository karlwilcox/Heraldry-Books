<h1>Fascis</h1>
<p>Fascis. The Roman-Fasces, or Lictors rods. A bundle of polished rods, in the middle of which was an axe, to express the power of life and death. It was carried before the Eoman Consuls, by the lictors, as an ensign of the superior magistrates. The Fasces are now frequently given to those who have held magisterial offices. <a href="../plate43.html">P.  43,</a>  f. 6.  </p>
