<h1>Fleur-de-lis</h1>
<p>Fleur-de-lis, contracted de-lis. Also termed Flower-de-luce ; is variously depicted, but most commonly as <a href="../plate44.html">P.  44,</a>  f. 7. Antique as f. 12. </p>
<p>As to its origin antiquaries are at variance,some supposing it to be the flower of the iris, others that of the common lily, whose name " lys " has a certain resemblance to that of Loys, or Louis, a common name of the Kings of France, while a third party, with perhaps more probability, suppose it to be the head of a partizan, or halbert. When the field, or any charge, is promiscuously scattered over with de-lys-, it is termed strewed, powdered, or replenished with fleur-de-lis ; or it is said to be Semee-de-lis. <a href="../plate1.html">P.  1.</a>  f. 38.  </p>
