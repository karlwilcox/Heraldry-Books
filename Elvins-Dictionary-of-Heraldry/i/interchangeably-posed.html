<h1>Interchangeably-posed</h1>
<p>Interchangeably-posed. As fish lying across each other, the heads and tails interchangeably posed, the head of each appearing between the tails of the others. This might be blazoned three fish, two in saltire heads upwards, one in pale head downwards. <a href="../plate32.html">P.  32,</a>  f. 25.  </p>
