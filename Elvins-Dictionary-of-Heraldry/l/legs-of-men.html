<h1>Legs of Men</h1>
<p>Legs of Men, Animals, and Birds, are of common use in Heraldry. Animals legs are termed Gambs which see. Birds legs, when erased, are termed A-la-Quise to which refer. </p>
<p>Men's legs are borne in various ways inCoat-Armour, and each form should be particularly expressed in blazon ; but it is always to be understood that when a man's leg is blazoned couped, or erased at the thigh, it is to be bent at the knee, whether clad in armour or not, as a leg in armour, couped at the thigh. <a href="../plate36.html">P.  36</a>  f. 22. and f. 23. A leg erased at the thigh, and other examples. Same plate, and <a href="../plate38.html">P.  38,</a>  f. 18.  </p>
