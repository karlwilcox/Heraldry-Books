<h1>Lion</h1>
<p>Lion. The noblest of all wild beasts, which is made to be the emblem of strength and valour, and is on that account the most frequently borne in Coat-Armour, as a Charge, Crest, and Supporter. The Heraldic Lion is always armed and langued gules unless such be the tincture of the field, when, if not named to the contrary, it is azure. See Languid.  </p>
