<p>Women take the same rank as their husbands, or as their brothers ; but the daughterof a peer marrying a Commoner retains her Title as Lady or Honourable. Daughters of Peers rank next immediately after the wives of their elder brothers, and before their younger brothers' wives. Daughters of Peers marrying Peers of lower degree take the same order of precedency as that of their husbands ; thus the daughter of a Duke marrying a Baron degrades to the rank of Baroness only, while her sisters married to commoners retain their rank and take precedence of the Baroness. Merely official rank on the husband's part does not give any similar precedence to the wife. </p>
<p>Local Precedency. No written code of county or city order of precedence has beenpromulgated. but naturally in the county the Lord-Lieutenant stands first, and secondly the High sheriff. In London and other Corporations the Mayor stands first, after him the Sheriffs, Aldermen. Chief Officers, and Livery. At Oxford and Cambridge the High sheriff takes precedence of the Vice-Chancellor.  </p>
