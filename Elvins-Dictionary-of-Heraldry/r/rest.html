<h1>Rest</h1>
<p>Rest, Clarion, or Claricord, <a href="../plate43.html">P.  43,</a>  f, 27 and 28. </p>
<p>A difference of opinion exists as to whatthis charge represents. Some bhizon it a horseman's rest, and assprt that it was the re?t in which the tilting-spear was fixed. Others contend that it was a wind instrument, and blazon it Clarion, or Claricorde. Some consider then to be Sufflues, instruments which transmit the wind from the billows to the organ, while others term them brackets or organ rests. See Clarion.  </p>
