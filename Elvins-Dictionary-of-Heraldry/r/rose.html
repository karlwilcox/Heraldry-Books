<h1>Rose</h1>
<p>Rose. Is borne depicted naturally, and heraldicly. <a href="../plate44.html">P.  44,</a>  f. 1 and 3. </p>
<p>The Heraldic Rose is always shewn fullblown, with the petala, or flower-leaves expanded, seeded in the middle, and backed by five green barbs, or involucra ; this Rose, when gules, is never to be called proper, whereas the rose borne naturally, is always when gules termed proper, and is always stalked and leaved, and termed a Rose slipped. The Heraldic Rose may be of any tincture, and is said to be barbed and seeded of such a colour, which must be expressed, unless the seeds are yellow and the barbs vert, when it is blazoned a Rose of such a colour, seeded and barbed proper. The Rose is used as a distinction for the seventh son. See Distinction of Houses. <a href="../plate46.html">P.  46.</a>   </p>
