<h1>Thyrsus</h1>
<p>Thyrsus. A rod surmounted with a fir-cone, or a bunch of vine leaves or ivy, with grapes or berries, carried by Bacchus, and the vSatyrs, Msenads, and others, during the celebration of religious rites. Beneath the garland or fir-cone the Thyrsus ends in the sharp point of a spear, a puncture from which induces madness. Two Thursi in Saltire, borne by the family of Fructuozo.  </p>
