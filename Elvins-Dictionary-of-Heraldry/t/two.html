<h1>Two and One</h1>
<p>Two and One. When three charges are borne on a field, two in chief, and one in base, they are sometimes blazoned two and one. </p>
<p>This disposition of three charges is alwaysso understood, if not ordered otherwise, and therefore it is unnecessary to use the term two and one ; but if more than three charges of the same description are borne in a field their position must be named, e.g <a href="../plate40.html">P.  40,</a>  f. 17. Seven mascles conjoined or conjanet three, three and one. <a href="../plate20.html">P.  20,</a>  f. 39. Five roses in saltier. <a href="../plate12.html">P.  12,</a>  f. .3. For examples of three charges in a field, see <a href="../plate31.html">P.  31,</a>  f. 3, and f. 30 to 35.  </p>
