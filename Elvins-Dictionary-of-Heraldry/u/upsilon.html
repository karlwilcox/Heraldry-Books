<h1>Upsilon</h1>
<p>Upsilon. The Greek Y, borne by the name of Clark. </p>
<p>Westenius, de lingua Graeca, tells us thatPythagoras invented the Y of the original alphabet, as a representation of the path of life. The foot is said to represent infancy, the two forks, two paths, the one leading to good, the other to evil.  </p>
