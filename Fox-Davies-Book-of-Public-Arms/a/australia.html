<p class="content"> [Assigned by Royal Warrant, 7th May 1908.]</p>

<p class="content"> The banner carried for Australia at the Coronation of King George Vshowed the arms assigned in 1908. Some years previously, as the result of a public competition, an " Australian flag" had been adopted and was most improperly recognised by the Colonial Office. The flag is blue, and at the hoist a canton of the Union, and below this a large star, and in the fly a representation of the five stars of the Southern Cross. The Governor-General of Australia flies the Union flag, and in the centre a seven pointed yellow star, surmounted by the crown, and within a wreath of foliage.</p>

<p class="content"> A floral badge — the Wattle — is sometimes claimed and used as emblematical of Australia.</p>

<p class="content"> The Commonwealth of Australia consists of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia, to which refer. <a href="../u/university-of-sydney.html">See also City of Sydney</a>.</p>
