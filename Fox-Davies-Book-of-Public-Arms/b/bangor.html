<p class="content"><span class="entry">BANGOR </span>(Carnarvonshire). Has no armorial bearings. Burke's " General Armory " quotes the arms as the same as those of the See of Bangor, which are " Gules, a bend or, guttee-de-poix between two mullets pierced argent." The seal of the Corporation, however, has an escutcheon gules, on a bend or, guttee-de-poix, a bend wavy azure, thereon a representation of a mace . . ., all between two mullets argent. Crest â€” A griffin couchant. The Corporation notepaper shows (presumably) a copy of the seal minus its legend, but the colours of the escutcheon are there changed ; but as they become " metal upon metal," and this is therefore a breach of heraldic law, little attention need be paid to it.</p>
