<p class="content"><span class="entry">BRACKLEY </span>(Northamptonshire). Has no armorial bearings. The arms of Egerton and Stanley have, however, been appropriated and are borne quarterly, namely,</p>
<p class="content"> 1 and 4 argent, a lion rampant gules, between three pheons sable (for Egerton),</p>
<p class="content"> 2 and 3, argent, on a bend azure, three stags' heads cabossed or (for Stanley). Crests — I. A lion rampant gules, supporting an arrow proper, barbed and flighted argent (for Egerton). 2. On a chapeau gules, turned up ermine, an eagle with wings endorsed or, standing on a child proper, swaddled gules banded argent (for Stanley). The arms are so given in Burke's " General Armory," and appear upon the seal, and the seal is duly recorded in the Visitation Books, but with the note added thereto — "This Seal was presented to the Corporation by John, Earl of Bridgwater, Lord of the Manor, soon after the Restoration." The above arms were of course his own, but I doubt if the entering of them as upon the seal at the visitation, particularly as the note above quoted was added, conferred them upon the Corporation.</p>
