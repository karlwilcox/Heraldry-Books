<p class="content"><span class="entry">BRIDGWATER </span>(Somersetshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal represents a castle upon a bridge, within the legend " Sigillum Maioris et ballorum burgi ac villae de Bridgwater."</p>
<p class="content"> Burke, in his " General Armory," however, ascribes arms to the town as follows : —</p>
<pre class="quotation">
" Bridgewater, Town of, (Somersetshire). — Gu. a castle with three towers an, the dexter and sinister tower domed, the castle standing on a bridge in base over a river, all ppr., on the dexter side of the centre tower an estoile, and on the sinister a fleur-de-lis, both or. The Corporation Seal is very ancient, and represents a castle surmounted by two others placed pyramidically and embattled. The castle stands on a bridge of Gothic work, with water underneath ; on each side of the first castle a domed tower surmounted with a ball, the grand entrance portcullised at the top, and against the door a man's head couped close in chief, on the dexter side an estoile, on the sinister a fleur-de-lis.
