<p class="content"><span class="entry">BURTON-ON-TRENT </span>(Staffordshire). Has no arms. Those claimed for the town and given in Burke's "General Armory" and in Debrett's "House of Commons " are " Barry wavy of six argent and azure, on a chief gules an eagle displayed between two fleurs-de-lis or." Upon the Corporation notepaper a motto is added, namely, " Honor alit artes," but the arms are there engraved " Azure three bars wavy argent, on a chief gules, etc., etc." This of course is 
colour upon colour and a breach of heraldic law. The escutcheon is also 
surmounted by a mural coronet, borne after the manner of a coronet of rank. 
This is a piece of absurdity which cannot be too highly deprecated. In some 
MS. collections in the College of Arms, which, not being Records, are not 
considered authoritative, a coat is given for Burton, namely, " Barry wavy of 
eight argent and azure, on a chief gules a peacock in his pride proper, between 
two fleurs-de-lys or," but this, which is almost identical with the coat of 
Newark, has never been officially recognised as of any authority. The Town- 
Clerk, writing to the editor, adds, " The Seal docs not represent the arms of the 
Borough, as the Town Council did not care to go to the expense of taking them 
out." Apparently Burton does not rise to the occasion. Can't somebody get 
up a subscription ? </p>
