<p class="content"> In the Visitation of the Country in the year 16S4 it is stated that the arms, crest, and supporters were granted by Robert Cooke, Clarenceux King of Arms, June 7, 1575. The record retained in the College of Arms of the said grant starts " A creast with Supporters confirmed to the auncient armes of the Towne &amp; broughe of Cambridge," blazons the achievement as follows,</p>
<pre class="quotation">
" Gules a bridge in chief a flower de luce gold between two roses silver on a poynt wave three botes sables the creast on a mounte verte a bridge silver. The Supporters two neptunes horses, the upper part gules, the nether part proper fyned gold."

<p class="content"> The drawing of the Crest, of which the illustration is an exact representation, is not very like a bridge. Burke in his "General Armory" makes several mistakes in blazoning the arms.</p>
