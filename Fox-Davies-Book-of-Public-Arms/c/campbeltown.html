<p class="content"><span class="entry">CAMPBELTOWN </span>(Argyllshire). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. The seal shows an escutcheon quarterly of four. In the first quarter is a tower on a mount, the second is gyronny of eight or and sable, in the third quarter is a lymphad, and in the fourth a fret. (The second and third quarter are evidently taken from the arms of Campbell, Dukes of Argyll.) The Motto surrounding the escutcheon is " Ignavis precibus fortuna repugnat," and the Legend, " Sigillum comune burgi de Campbeltn."</p>
