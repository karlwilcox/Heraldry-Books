<p class="content"><span class="entry">CARDIFF, </span>City of (Glamorganshire). Erected into a city October 28, 1905. Argent, on a mount vert, a dragon rampant gules, supporting in front of a leek issuing from the mount a flag-staff erect proper, flowing therefrom to the sinister a Banner of the third, charged with three chevronels of the first. Crest — A Tudor rose on three ostrich feathers argent, issuing out of a mural crown proper. Supporters — On the dexter side a goat and on the sinister side a sea-horse, both proper. Mottoes — (over crest) " Deffro mae'n Ddydd," (under arms) " Y ddraig goch ddyry gychwyn."</p>
<p class="content"> [The arms were granted by patent, August 26, 1906. The crest was assigned by Royal Warrant, dated October 6, 1906, under the hand of His Majesty King Edward VII., the same being exemplified by a subsequent patent. The supporters were granted by Sir Alfred Scott-Gatty, Garter King of Arms, by patent dated February 25, 1907. Prior to the elevation of Cardiff to the dignity of a city, arms, sometimes " gules, three chevronels or, " sometimes with the tinctures reversed, were used as the arms of Cardiff, and were supposed to be derived from the arms of the De Clares. These are perpetuated in the new arms, the national emblems of the leek and the red dragon being introduced. The crest is derived from the badge of the Prince of Wales, hence the necessity of the Royal Warrant, the Tudor rose {i.e. a white rose within a red rose) being taken from the old seal of the borough.]</p>
