<p class="content"><span class="entry">CARDIGAN </span>(Cardiganshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal is described in Burke's " General Armory " as representing an antique castle triple-towered and embattled, and on the reverse a ship under sail. The seal in use at present, according to an impression which has been forwarded to me, is divided into two compartments, that on the dexter side having a castle therein, and a ship occupying the sinister division. The seal has the motto, " Anchora spei cereticas est in te Domine." The legend is " Sigillum commune burgensium de Cardigan." But the Mayor's notepaper represents an escutcheon party per pale, on the dexter side a triangular castle, and on the sinister side a ship at sea in full sail.</p>
