<p class="content"><span class="entry">CARRICKFERGUS </span>(Co. Antrim). Has no armorial bearings. The seal of the Port and Customs of Carrickfergus shows an escutcheon charged with three harps, two and one. But the seal of the town represents upon water a castle triple-towered, the port open, in chief two birds, and on either side of the castle foliage. The legend is " Sigillum comunede Cragferg." The editor is indebted to a pamphlet published by Mr John Vinycomb for the foregoing information.</p>
