<p class="content"> The Channel Islands, the sole remaining portion of the Dukedom of Normandy still appertaining to the English Crown, are not a portion of the United Kingdom, of which they are simply a dependency, and consequently, upon the coinage and elsewhere, the arms of Scotland and Ireland are not introduced. One instance has come under the editor's notice in which the charges are distinctly leopards. Whether such a practice is strictly legal is certainly open to question. <a href="../g/great-torrington.html">Refer to " Great Britain</a>."</p>
