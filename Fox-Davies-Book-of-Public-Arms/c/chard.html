<p class="content"><span class="entry">CHARD </span>(Somerset). Has no armorial bearings. The seal, which is of a pointed oval shape, represents two peacocks (?) of most wonderful and amazing construction, one on either side of a central floriated ornament adorned with two acorns. The legend is " Sigillum burgi de Chard, 1570."</p>
