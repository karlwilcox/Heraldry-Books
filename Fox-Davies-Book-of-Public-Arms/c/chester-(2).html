Whereas Venerable Men the Mayor and Citizens of the City of Chester as also their predecessors have been endowed with many and distinguished privileges by the Kings of England and the Palatine Earls of Chester and have been incorporated by the name of the Mayor and Citizens of the City of Chester by the virtue of which incorporation indeed the aforesaid City (as also other Cities of the Kingdom of England) is rendered much more renowned and notable by the long use and display of Arms or insignia BUT SINCE by the ancient Arms and Insignia of the aforesaid City having been laid aside and almost entirely eff"aced from Memory they have assumed to themselves other new and pretended insignia and have used the same for many past years, in which thing a grave error was committed by the negligence and carelessness of those whom it chiefly concerned AND because there is neither found above the aforesaid Ancient Arms or Insignia (which has commonly and to some others likewise happened) any helmet of augmentation (which they call tymbrum or Crest) properly emblazoned, nor at the sides of

"Therefore I the aforesaid Norrey King of Arms not only having performed that which belongs to my office in the reformation of errors of former times have restored to the said City fully and entirely by (these) presents the ancient arms or insignia distinguished by red and azure or blue of which the first part (which can be truly stiled Royal) displays as splendidly as possible three dimidiated lions passant and regardient or, but the other part borrowed from Earls palatine themselves bears one entire garb and another dimidiated garb or, before it — And moreover having been earnestly entreated that I would not fail the aforesaid City on this part, but that rather so far as in me lies I should gratify a city and society so illustrious and so well deserving of our prince and country, for the greater and more ample dignity of the said City I have assigned for crest over the helmet an upright sword sheathed, the emblem of Majesty and Justice, encircled by a fillet adorned throughout with gold situated over a collar distinguished by gold, red, and azure colours, together with mantlings and appendages folded partly red and partly azure, on the inside lined with silver. And furthermore I have appointed for the support of the buckler or shield on the dexter a Lion crowned about the neck with a silver crown, and on the sinister a Wolf argent in like manner girt about the neck with a golden crown even as for the more full and clear understanding of these I have caused them to be illuminated, delineated, and painted more to life in their proper metals and colours in the margin of these presents. The which ancient insignia of the shield, together with the apex or crest of a helmet placed upon it, and also the aforesaid collateral animals sustaining and supporting the said shield. I the before named Norrey King of Arms by virtue and authority of my function and office granted to me by the Queens Majesty in this behalf that I might willingly give honour to the Honourable the said Mayor and citizens of the aforesaid City of Chester and to their successors to the greater increase of honour and dignity and perpetual ornament of the said City have given delivered and by these presents have confirmed in perpetuity. To have to use and to display for the sake of honour in whatsoever place and at ^^l)atsoever ti'me at their sole will and pleasure any impediment, contradiction or prohibition which God forbid notwithstanding. In Faith and testimony in all and singular of which I the aforesaid Norroy King of Arms have by these presents with my own proper hand subscribed my name and by the appending of the Seal of my Office have confirmed this my present diploma Given, at Chester the third day of September in the year of our Saviour Christ 1580 and in the 22nd year of the reign of Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth.
