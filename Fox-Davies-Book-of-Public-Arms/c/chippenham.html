<p class="content"><span class="entry">CHIPPENHAM </span>(Wiltshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal recorded in the visitations of the County represents a tree, and suspended therefrom two escutcheons. Burke, in his " General Armory," blazons the whole as a coat-of arms as follows : — " Argent, a tree of three large branches vert, between two escutcheons — viz., that on the dexter azure ten billets argent, in chief a label of five points of the last, the sinister escutcheon or, three legs in armour proper, garnished or, coupled at the middle of the thigh two and one, on each a spur of the last. Motto—' Unity and loyalty.' "</p>
