<p class="content"><span class="entry">CHIPPING SODBURY </span>(Gloucestershire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal recorded in the visitation books shows an escutcheon without tinctures charged with three lions passant guardant in pale. This is probably simply the Royal Coat. The legend is "The Burough of Chipping Sodbury, 1680."</p>
