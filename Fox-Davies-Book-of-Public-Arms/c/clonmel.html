<p class="content"><span class="entry">CLONMEL </span>(Co. Tipperary). Has no armorial bearings registered in Ulster's Office. Those used are as follows — namely, " Argent, over water, therein three fishes naiant, two and one, a bridge of five arches and thereon a stag in full course pursued by a greyhound all proper." Crest — A raven proper. Supporters — On either side a greyhound proper, gorged with a collar . . . Motto — " Fidelis in JEternum." The common seal of the town of Clonmel represents upon a wreath a sword erect point upwards, the blade enfiled by two branches {) of laurel) in saltire, with the motto " Hsec inde." The Mayor's seal represents a figure of Justice which is sometimes quoted as the arms. Is it simply a coincidence that the dexter supporter of Lord Clonmel's achievement is also a figure of Justice?</p>
