<p class="content"><span class="entry">CONGLETON </span>(Cheshire). Has no armorial bearings. The following are, however, claimed and used : — " Sable, a chevron between three tuns argent." Crest — Upon water proper and between two lucies or (.' conger-eels) haurient and issuant therefrom a tun floating proper, thereon a lion statant guardant gules. Motto — " Sit tibi sancta cohors comitum." The colours of the shield are also quoted vice versa. The Crest is the design taken bodily from the older seal belonging to the Borough. The seal itself is of brass, and is supposed to date from the thirteenth century. The Town-Clerk, in a most courteous letter, informs me that an impression of the seal is attached to the first charter {circa 1286) by Henry de Lacy, Earl of Chester, as Commissary of King Henry HI. Another seal of a later date (1624) shows a rose surmounted by a Royal Crown between the letters l.R. This is of silver.</p>
