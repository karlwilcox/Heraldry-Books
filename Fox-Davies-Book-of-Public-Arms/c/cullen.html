<p class="content"><span class="entry">CULLEN </span>(Banffshire). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. The seal represents the Virgin standing on a kind of throne and holding the infant Jesus ; and below is a dog. The legend is " Sigillum urbis de Cullen." Many corporate seals exhibits a great crudeness in the design and in the engraving, but in the opinion of the editor the seal of Cullen is far and away the most lamentable.</p>
