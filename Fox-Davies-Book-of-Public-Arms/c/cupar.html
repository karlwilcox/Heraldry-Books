<p class="content"><span class="entry">CUPAR </span>or CUPAR-FIFE (Fifeshire). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. Three seals all bearing slightly different achievements have come under the editor's notice. As to the arms, it is an open question whether the field be gules or whether it be or. The charges seem to be always shown as three wreaths of laurel, but one seal adds a double tressure flory and counterflory. There does not appear to be any variation as to the Crest, " a lion rampant," or as to the Motto, " Unitas," but one of the seals shows as supporters on either side of the escutcheon an angel, the two interior wings being crossed in saltire above the escutclieon, and each holding in their exterior hands a palm-branch.</p>
