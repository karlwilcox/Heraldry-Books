<p class="content"><span class="entry">DEAL </span>(Kent). Has no armorial bearings. The seal represents party per pale, three demi-lions passant guardant in pale conjoined to as many hulks of ships. (<a href="../b/bath-king-of-arms.html">Refer to the Cinque Ports</a>.) On the Corporation notepaper there is the same achievement used as a coat-of-arms, with the colours shown as follows : â€” Per pale gules and azure three demi-lions passant guardant in pale conjoined to as many hulks of ships argent. The Corporation also use as a crest two towers placed immediately upon or issuing from the top of the shield. The editor would suggest that if the said towers were placed upon a wreath (see illustration) it would be more in accord with the laws of heraldry, and if the Corporation would obtain a grant of arms in the proper manner it would be better still.</p>
