<p class="content"><span class="entry">DERBYSHIRE. </span>Has no armorial bearings. Those in use for a long time have been " Argent a rose (? gules) regally crowned (? or)," and these (with lettering enough to stock a type-founder) now appear upon the seal of the County Council. Berry quoted them in his "Dictionary of Heraldry," but as "Argent, a treble rose regally crowned between the letters A and R." Occasionally the arms attributed to the town of Derby (argent, on a mount vert, a stag lodged within park-pales and gate, all proper) have been used for the County.</p>
