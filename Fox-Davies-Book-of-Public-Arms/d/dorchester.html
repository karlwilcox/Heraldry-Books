<p class="content"><span class="entry">DORCHESTER </span>(Dorset). Has no armorial bearings. The seal at present in use represents a castle triple-towered upon a mount, and in front of the castle an escutcheon quarterly, i and 4 France and England quarterly, 2 Scotland, 3 Ireland. The legend is, " The Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of Dorchester, Dorset, 1836." The ancient seal, confirmed by Hervy Clarenceux in 1565, has the shield in front of the castle quarterly of 4, viz., I and 4 France (ancient), 2 and 3 England, and a different legend. Burke, in his " General Armory," quotes this as a coat-of-arms, making the field gules and the castle argent, masoned sable upon a rock proper.</p>
