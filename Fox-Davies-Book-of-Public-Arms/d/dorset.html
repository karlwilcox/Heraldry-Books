<p class="content"><span class="entry">DORSET, </span>County of. Has no armorial bearings. It is usually credited with some design taken with varying accuracy from the seal of Dorchester, but the seal of the County Council e.vhibits (without tinctures) three lions passant gardant in pale. These are probably suggested by the old seal of Melcome Regis.</p>
