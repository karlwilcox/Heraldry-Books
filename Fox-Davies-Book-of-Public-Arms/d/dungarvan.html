<p class="content"><span class="entry">DUNGARVAN </span>(Co. Waterford). Has no armorial bearings registered in Ulster's Office. The " Common Seal of the advisers of Dungarvan " represents a number of figures, five of whom are crowned, around a table upon which are a number of maps, within an Irish motto (see illustration of the arms), the literal translation of which is " Not a mariner until a helmsman." The arms in use at the present time are, however, " Argent, on waves of the sea a two-masted ship sailing to the sinister between on either side on rocks a square tower all proper." Crest — An anchor sans beam, entwined by a dolphin haurient head downwards, all proper. Supporters — On the dexter side a warrior vested in a cloak and kilt, in his belt a sword, in his dexter hand a lance, and in his sinister a bow unstrung. On the sinister side a warrior habited in knee-breeches and a short cloak, his dexter hand supporting a battle-axe head downwards, and on his sinister arm a shield. Motto, in ancient Irish characters, for which <a href="../i/institution.html">see illustration</a>. The Town-Clerk, in a very courteous letter, informs me that the arms were designed (! ! !) about 30 years ago after a very exhaustive search had failed to discover the least trace of any insignia which had belonged to or been used by the ancient and extinct Corporation of Dungarvan.</p>
