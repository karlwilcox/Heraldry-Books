<p class="content"><span class="entry">ELY </span>(Cambridgeshire). Has no armorial bearings. Berry adds a note : â€” " This city is not a corporation, and therefore hath not any Arms." Those of the See, viz., "gu. three ducal coronets, two and one or," are by many persons, although erroneously, said to be the arms of the city.</p>
