<p class="content"><span class="entry">FENTON </span>(Staffordshire). Had no armorial bearings, and, moreover, was not entitled to bear them. Still the following have had very extensive use : — Argent, a cross diapered (of a lozenge pattern), between, in the first quarter, a vase (or souptureen) ; in the second, upon a mount two pottery kilns ; in the third, upon a mount a representation of a pit-mouth (.') ; in the fourth, upon a mount a garb in front of a plough, presumably all proper. Crest — A goat's head erased proper. Motto — " Onward and upward." The goat's head is said to be the crest of a family named Baker, who have for a long time resided in Fenton. It would be interesting to know if they had established any right to it themselves before passing it on to Fenton, who assuredly can have had none. Fenton now forms part of the Amalgamated Borough of Stoke-on-Trent, to wliich refer.</p>
