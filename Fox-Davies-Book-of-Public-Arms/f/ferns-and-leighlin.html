<p class="content"> [This coat, which is recorded in Ulster's Office, remains in use, but through the disestablishment of the Irish Church it is really extinct and its present use is illegal. Woodward gives the foregoing coat as that of Leighlin, and attributes to Ferns that given by Burke as the modern arms of Ossory.]</p>
