<p class="content"><span class="entry">FOWEY </span>(Cornwall). Has no armorial bearings. Berry, in his " Dictionary of Heraldry," says, "The seal seems to be originally intended for an armorial ensign, viz., on a shield a ship of three masts on the sea, her topsail furled. The legend round it, 'Sigillum oppidi de Fowy, Anno Dom. 1702.'"</p>
