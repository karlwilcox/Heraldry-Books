<p class="content"><span class="entry">FURRIERS </span>(Edinburgh). Berry, in his description of the arms on the Gold Medal of the Deacon-Convener of the Corporate Bodies of Trades in Edinburgh (refer sub Edinburgh), gives for the Furriers : " Ermine, on a chief gules, three imperial crowns proper." But these are identical with the arms of the Skinners of London and the United Glovers and Skinners of Exeter, and perhaps Berry is wrong, and that the arms used by the Furriers are those he ascribed to the Skinners, viz., " party per fesse gules and argent, a pale counter changed on first three goats salient of the second."</p>
