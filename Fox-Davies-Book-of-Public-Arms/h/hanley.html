<p class="content"><span class="entry">HANLEY </span>(Staffordshire). Has no armorial bearings. On the old Corporation notepaper and on the seal, however, the following somewhat intricate representation appeared : Party per pale and per chevron, the dexter side barry of six or and ermine, three jugs proper (or perhaps azure); the sinister side ermine a cross voided sable between four towers flammant proper, the base gules four mullets, one two and one argent. Crest â€” A camel kneeling, bridled and burdened (or perhaps the burden was intended for an escutcheon of St George) proper. Around the escutcheon was a cord tied in what one must imagine was the designer's idea of indicating the locality of Hanley by a series of Stafford knots. It was decidedly a pretty idea, but is a striking example of the truth of the old adage, " A little knowledge is a dangerous thing," for the result was to surround the so-called armorial bearings of Hanley with a very close resemblance to the insignia of the Order of the Cordeliere of France, which was confined to widow ladies of noble family. Hanley now forms part of the Amalgamated Borough of Stoke-on-Trent, to which refer.</p>
