<p class="content"><span class="entry">HAVERFORDWEST </span>(Pembrokeshire). Has no armorial bearings. Burke in his " General Armory " says, " The Arms are generally said to be an old man's head in profile couped at the neck. The seal represents a castle triple-towered on a mount, from the centre a man blowing a horn, on each of the other towers a flag, the tower supported by two heraldic tigers." Debrett's " House of Commons " gives an illustration which would pass for the above, with the legend, " The Seal of Office of the Borough of Haverfordwest." But an impression (perhaps of a different seal) which has come under the editor's notice represents a castle of three towers, the centre one very much the tallest, and therefrom a man blowing a horn to the sinister, on each of the outer towers a flag ; on the dexter side of the castle is an heraldic tiger, and on the sinister is an eagle perched and regardant, its back towards the tower. At the base is a wyvern (?). The legend is " Sigillum comune de Hawerfordia."</p>
