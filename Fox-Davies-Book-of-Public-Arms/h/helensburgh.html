<p class="content"><span class="entry">HELENSBURGH </span>(Dumbartonshire). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. Those doing duty upon the seal are peculiar ! ! They consist of an achievement which the editor understands purports to be that of Colquhoun of Luss impaled with Sutherland, and consequently that of Sir James Grant or Colquhoun of Luss, first Baronet (of the United Kingdom), who married, 1 2th April 1740, Helen, daughter of William, Lord Strathnaver, and sister of William, i6th Earl of Sutherland. The arms are, on the dexter side (for Colquhoun), Argent, a saltire engrailed sable, and on an inescutcheon in chief the badge of Ulster as a Baronet of the United Kingdom. On the sinister side (for Sutherland), Gules three mullets or, on a bordure of the last a double tressure flory and counterflory of the first. Below the shield hangs the badge of a Baronet of Nova Scotia ! ! ! Perhaps the engraver didn't know which Sir James was, so put in both badges to make sure of having the right one somehow. For Crest — A hart's head couped gules, attired argent. For Supporters — On the de.xter side a ratch-hound argent, collared sable (both supporters of Colquhoun of Luss are as this), and on the sinister side a savage wreathed about the head and middle with leaves and holding over his exterior shoulder a club all proper. Mottoes (over the crest) — "Si je puis," (under the arms) " Cnoc elachan." A baronet's helmet and a lambrequin surmount the escutcheon upon the seal.</p>
