<p class="content"><span class="entry">HONITON </span>(Devonshire). Has not any armorial bearings. The seal represents on the dexter side a branch of honeysuckle below a human figure, affrontee erased at the waist, holding its dexter hand towards a female three-quarter length figure in profile vested. In chief is a dexter hand fesseways, couped at the wrist, the third and fourth fingers doubled down. The legend is " The Common Seal of the Borough of Honiton, Devon, 1846."</p>
<p class="content"> An interesting article by J. Gale Pedrick in relation to the charges upon the seal appears in the Genealogical Magazine, vol. ii. pp. 18-22.</p>
