<p class="content"><span class="entry">HUDDERSFIELD </span>(Yorkshire). Or, on a chevron between three rams passant sable, as many towers argent. Crest — A ram's head couped argent, armed or, gorged with a collar sable, holding in the mouth a sprig of the cotton-tree, slipped and fructed proper. Motto — " Juvat impigros Deus."</p>
<p class="content"> Granted by Sir Charles George Young, Knt, Garter Principal King of Arms, Robert Laurie, Clarenceux King of Arms, William Aston Blount, Norroy King of Arms, October 12, 1868.</p>
<p class="content"> The rams upon the escutcheon and the ram's head in the crest are, of course, an allusion to the fact that the freehold of the town of Huddersfield has almost exclusively belonged to the Ramsden family. The legend runs that at one time a former Sir John Ramsden was the possessor of the whole of the town, with the exception of a small house and smithy belonging to a labouring blacksmith of Quaker persuasion. Wishing to purchase this land, and thus possess the whole of the town, the Baronet called on the Quaker and asked if the latter were willing to sell. The blacksmith asked what price was offered.</p>
<pre class="quotation">
" I will cover this kitchen floor with sovereigns," answered the Baronet. " Wilt thee lay them edge upwards?" "No, I will cover your floor with them, but I will lay them flat." This was refused, the Quaker ending the conversation by saying, "Ah, well then, Sir John, Huddersfield belongs to thee and to me."
</pre>
<p class="content"> It always seems to me a pity to discredit a good tale, but the occasion sometimes arises. In order to obtain an authentic confirmation or denial of the story, the present Sir John Ramsden, Baronet, was written to, and the letter brought the following reply : —</p>
<pre class="quotation">
"As regards the subject of your letter, I am directed to say that Sir John is sorry he can give no information as to the legend, often repeated with variations, and often appearing in print ; but Sir John never heard it from any member of his own family, even as a tradition, and an old Quaker gentleman, the descendant and heir of the Quaker who figures in the story, and from whom Sir John himself bought the land in question many years ago, assured him there was no truth in it whatever."
