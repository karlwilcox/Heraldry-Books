<p class="content"><span class="entry">HULL, </span>or more properly KINGSTON-UPON-HULL (Yorkshire). Azure, three ducal coronets in pale or.</p>
<p class="content"> Recorded in the College of Arms.</p>
<p class="content"> The origin of the coronets is said to be due to a company of " Merchant Adventurers," who, likening themselves to the three merchant kings of the East, who presented themselves with offerings at Bethlehem of old, assumed their three crowns as a device for the seal of the company, and this design being subsequently adopted by the town. My only authority for the foregoing tradition is a newspaper cutting.</p>
<p class="content"> A more likely origin may be found in the arms of the City of Cologne, and the habit of those who imported fine linen from that city to set up the arms thereof as indicative of the wares they dealt in.</p>
