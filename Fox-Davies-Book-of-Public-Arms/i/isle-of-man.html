<p class="content"><span class="entry">ISLE OF MAN. </span>Gules, three legs in armour flexed at the knee and conjoined at the thigh, all proper, garnished and spurred or. Recorded in the College of Arms. In a collection of crests by Le Neve a crest is assigned to this coat, namely, two arms embowed in armour argent, holding in the hands a gem-ring or, stoned sable, but this is hardly of authority, and I believe is never made use of Motto â€” " Stabit quocunque jeceris." The Isle of Man " Kneels to England, kicks at Scotland, and spurns Ireland."</p>
