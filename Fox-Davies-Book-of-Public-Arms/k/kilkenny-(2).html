<p class="content"><span class="entry">KILKENNY, </span>City of (Co. Kilkenny). Has no armorial bearings. But Burke in his " General Armory " quotes the following as a coat : â€” Argent, a castle of three towers, the centre one the tallest, and topped with a spire, on each of the others a man issuant, shooting an arrow from a bow, all proper, in base on a mount vert, a lion passant guardant gules. In a sheet of " Irish Arms " published by Messrs Marcus Ward &amp; Co., Limited, a design somewhat similar is shown, but the editor has been unable to obtain any authentic drawing of the coat.</p>
