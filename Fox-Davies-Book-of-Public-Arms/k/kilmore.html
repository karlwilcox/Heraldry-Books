<p class="content"><span class="entry">KILMORE, </span><a href="../f/f-r.html">See of</a>. Ancient Arms — Argent on a cross sable (Woodward gives azure) a pastoral staff surmounted of a mitre sans labels or. Modern Arms — Argent a cross gules, in each quarter five trefoils in saltire slipped vert.</p>

<p class="content"> [These latter arms are recorded in Ulster's Office and the modern coat remains in use, but through the disestablishment of the Irish Church, it is really extinct, and its present use is illegal.]</p>
