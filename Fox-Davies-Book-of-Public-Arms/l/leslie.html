Its shield shows a weird escutcheon divided per fesse and the chief per pale, containing {a) three garbs, (3) a mill, (r) a representation of one of the ancient entrances now disused of Leslie House. Crest — A demi-griffin. Mottoes — (Over crest) " grip fast " ; (under arms) " Industria vivimus."</p>
<p class="content"> [Bogus, and nearly as bad as the old arms of Southend.]</p>
