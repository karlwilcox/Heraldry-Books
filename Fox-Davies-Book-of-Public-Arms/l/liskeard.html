<p class="content"><span class="entry">LISKEARD </span>(Cornwall). Has no armorial bearings. The seal represents a fleur-de-lis, and perched thereupon, respecting each other, are two birds (Burke gives "beds," a palpable printer's blunder), in chief two annulets, and in the flanks two feathers. The legend is differently quoted, and I have been unable to obtain an actual impression of the seal.</p>
