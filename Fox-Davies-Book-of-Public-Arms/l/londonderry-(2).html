<p class="content"> The only authority remaining in Ulster's Office is a very rough sketch "in trick " with the note as set forth here above, bound up with other papers in a book of " Draft Grants," and for want of any other I take this as my authority, though I am aware that it differs considerably from the arms as quoted by Burke in his " General Armory " and from the form in use. Why an Irish harp is almost invariably charged upon the cross in the chief, I am at a loss to understand. — Ed.</p>
<p class="content"> The arms as they appear upon the Town Clerk's note-paper are in form very similar to the illustration herein, but are surrounded by a trophy of military flags and weapons, and are surmounted by a crest, namely, "an Irish harp surmounted by a royal crown," and further the field is shown to be azure. The whole design, so the Town-Clerk writes, is "exactly the same as worked by the French prisoners on the tapestry in the Bank of Ireland, the Old House of Lords, about the year 17 10," though he further adds that "the upper part is argent and gules, and the lower half proper." Debrett's " House of Commons " makes the arms " per fess," the field " azure," charges the cross with an " Irish harp," and puts the sword in the arms of the City of London in the " second " quarter.</p>
