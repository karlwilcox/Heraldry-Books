<p class="content"><span class="entry">MARLBOROUGH </span>(Wiltshire). Party per saltiie gules and azure, in chief a bull passant argent, armed or, in fesse two capons and in base three grey-hounds courant in pale of the third, the latter collared of the first and ringed of the fourth : a chief also or, and thereon on a pale of the second, between two roses gules a tower triple-towered argent.</p>
<p class="content"> Recorded in the College of Arms.</p>
<p class="content"> The original arms of Marlborough as entered in the Visitation of Wiltshire, 1 565, are as upon the pale, namely. Azure, a tower triple-towered argent.</p>
<p class="content"> Both Burke and Berry credit the town with a crest (a tower argent), and supporters (two hounds) ; and as the editor is led to believe that these are made use of, they are added to the engraving, but it must be distinctly understood that they are bogus, the two coats-of-arms being everything that is genuine.</p>
<p class="content"> Berry adds the following note : —</p>
<pre class="quotation">
" The original Arms of Marlborough were, az. a tower triple-towered arg., as entered in the Visitation of the County of Wilts, taken 1565 ; as are also the before-mentioned Arms of Marlborough, with this note : ' These Arms are belonging and appertaining to the Borough, and are commonly called of the town and borough of Marlborough, in Wiltshire, in commemoration of the duty and homage heretofore said and done (time out of mind) by the burgesses and community to the mayor for the time being, his aldermen and brethren of the said town, at the receiving of the oath by any burgess by them admitted, at which time they do present to the mayor a leash of white greyhounds, one white bull, and two white capons ; in perpetual memory of which — I, Clarenceux, King of Arms, have ratified and confirmed the said Arms to the said borough and community for ever hereafter, without contradiction of any person."
