<p class="content"><span class="entry">MUCH WENLOCK </span>(Shropshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal, which was recorded at the visitations, represents a triple canopy, the centre compartment being occupied by the figure of a saint crowned with a nimbus, seated and supporting a crucifix ; on the dexter side is a figure crowned with a coronet, and holding a crosier in the sinister hand, and on the sinister is the figure of St George trampling on the dragon, though the engraver has made the holy saint left-handed, representing him as holding a sword in his left hand and his shield on his right arm. At the base of the seal are three escutcheons, the centre one charged with a lion rampant, the dexter with a stag trippant, and the sinister with a chevron between three blackamoors' heads. This last represents the arms of the ancient family of Wenlock of Wenlock, now extinct it is believed in the male line, but represented by Lord Wenlock, who is entitled (so the editor believes) to quarter these arms. They are suspended from the collars of his supporters. A smaller seal represents the letters W.E.N. , and a fetter-lock, i.e. Wen-lock.</p>
