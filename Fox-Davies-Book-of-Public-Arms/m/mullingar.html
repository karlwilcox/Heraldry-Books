<p class="content"><span class="entry">MULLINGAR </span>(Co. Westraeath). Has no armorial bearings registered in Ulster's Qfifice. The coat attributed to the town in the sheet of Irish arms published by Marcus Ward &amp; Co., Ltd., the design of which is taken, I believe, from the seal, is beyond my powers to blazon.</p>
