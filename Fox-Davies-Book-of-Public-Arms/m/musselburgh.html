<p class="content"><span class="entry">MUSSELBURGH </span>(Midlothian). The "Honest Town" of Musselburgh's arms are azure, three anchors in pale, one in chief and two in the flanks or, accompanied with as many mussels, two in the dexter and sinister chief points and the third in base proper. In an escroll above the shield this Motto â€” " Honesty." Matriculated in Lyon Register, 2nd October 1771. Signed R. Boswell, Lyon Dep.</p>
<p class="content"> The seal, which has the legend, " Sigillum commune de Musselburgi," shows the above arms, and in addition has for a crest a skeleton, a mantle flying from his shoulders, on his sinister arm an escutcheon charged with a cross, holding in his dexter hand a spear which he is piercing through a dragon overturned at his feet. The motto is here rendered " Honestas."</p>
