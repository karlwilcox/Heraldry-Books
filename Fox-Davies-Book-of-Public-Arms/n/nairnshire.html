"County Clerk's Office, Nairn, 14th August 1893. — Dear Sir, — I duly received your letter of the 4th, and I now enclose an impression of the Seal of the Nairn County Council. The Eagle is the Crest of Major Rose of Kilravock, Lord-Lieutenant of the County, the Swan that of the Earl of Cawdor, the Hand with three arrows that of Brodie of Brodie, and the Boar's Head that of the late General Baillie of Lochloy. The Families of Kilravock, Cawdor, and Brodie have been intimately identified with the history of the County for the last six centuries or more, and it was chiefly on this account that the Seal took its form. General Baillie being the first Convener of the County under the Local Government Act, it was thought appropriate that his Crest should also appear on the Seal. — Yours faithfully, (Signed) H. T. DONALDSON."
