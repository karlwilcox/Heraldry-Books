<p class="content"><span class="entry">NEWCASTLE-UNDER-LYME </span>(Staffordshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal, which is very intricate, and of an architectural design, has three escutcheons hanging from the battlements. That on the dexter side represents a lion rampant within a border charged with roundles ; that in the centre represents three lions passant guardant in pale ; that on the sinister represents three garbs, two and one, apparently the Royal Coats of Cornwall, England, and Chester. Rising above the battlements are the figures of two men, one blowing a horn, the other holding a battle-axe. The legend is " Sigill. comune burgensium novi castelli."</p>
