<p class="content"><span class="entry">NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE </span>(Northumberland). Gules, three towers tripletowered argent. Crest — On a wreath of the colours, a tower argent, therefrom issuant a demi-lion rampant guardant or, holding a flagstaff sable, therefrom flowing a split banner of St George. Supporters — On either side, a sea-horse argent, crined and finned or. Motto — " Fortiter defendit triumphans." The following extract is taken from Richardson's " Table Book " : —</p>

" At what period Armorial Bearings were first granted to the town of Newcastle-upon-Tyne has not been recorded ; but it may be inferred from an ancient shield formerly placed on the north front of the Newgate, which was pulled down in 1823, that they were used prior to the year 1390, at which period the gate is mentioned under the above appellation in an inquisition in the Tinmouth Chartulary at Northumberland House. The inference appears to be considerably strengthened by the circumstance of another shield containing the Arms of England having been sculptured on the right of the above, in which the fleur-de-lis were semee, the number of these having been reduced to three in the time of Henry V., Aug. 16, 1575. William Flower, Esq., Norroy King of Arms, granted the addition of a helmet, crest, and supporters to the ancient Arms of Newcastle. No motto occurs in this grant. In all probability the motto was added after the gallant defence of the town against the Scots." In speaking of the siege of Newcastle, the writer adds : — " Thus was the town taken from the King, after an obstinate and gallant defence, and may well assume the motto bestowed upon it by the unfortunate monarch — Fortiter defendit triumphans."
