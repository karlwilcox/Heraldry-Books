<p class="content"><span class="entry">NORTHUMBERLAND. </span>Has no armorial bearings. The arms attributed to Northumbria were paly of eight or and gules. Travesties, many of them very wide of the mark, upon the arms of Morpeth, have done duty on various occasions, but for accuracy it has been left to the seal of the Northumberland County Council to bear away the palm. The seal shows seven escutcheons, supposed or intended to represent respectively the arms of Northumbria, Berwick, Morpeth, Tynemouth, Corbridge, Hexham, and Alnwick. Of the seven, Morpeth alone is the only genuine coat-of-arms. Need more be said ?</p>
