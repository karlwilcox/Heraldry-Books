<p class="content"><span class="entry">PARTICK </span>(Lanarkshire). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. Those upon the seal, which appear to be in general use, are of quite recent invention, and are as follows : — Quarterly or and gules, in the first and fourth quarters a lymphad with sails furled and oars in action sable, in the second a castle tripletowered, and in the third a bishop's mitre labelled, both proper ; over all on a chief sable a garb, also proper, between two bezants (they are so blazoned in the Catalogue of the Heraldic Exhibition, but query if they really are ; the seal and notepaper before me are very indistinct, they may be intended for mill-stones. — Ed.). Crest^A steamboat. Motto — " Industria ditat."</p>
