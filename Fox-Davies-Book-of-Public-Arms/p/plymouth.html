<p class="content"><span class="entry">PLYMOUTH </span>(Devonshire). Argent, a saltire vert between four towers sable. Recorded in the College of Arms, as is also an older coat, namely, Gules, on waves of the sea proper, a three-masted ship or, on each mast a sail furled argent and a banner of St George, on the main-mast a round top. The saltire is supposed to be in allusion to St Andrew, the patron saint of the principal church of Plymouth. Upon the seal recorded in the visitation containing the first-mentioned arms the escutcheon is surmounted by a coronet composed of fleurs-de-lis and strawberry leaves. This coronet appears always to be made use of, though usually drawn as of fleurs-de-lis only (perhaps because Burke so quotes it as of eight). Likewise two supporters (two lions rampant guardant or) seem to have been appropriated without any authority, together with the Motto,</p>
<pre class="quotation">
"Turris fortissima est nomen Jehova." As it is invariably so used, an illustration is given of the whole, but it should be clearly understood that the escutcheon only is of any authority.
