<p class="content"><span class="entry">POOLE </span>(Dorsetshire). Barry wavy of ten a dolphin embowed, and in chief three escallops. In the visitation books no colours are given, and the bars are of unequal width. The editor has thought it better in this case, therefore, to adhere to the more generally quoted blazon, " Gules, three bars wavy or (sometimes argent, three bars wavy azure), over all a dolphin naiant embowed argent, in chief three escallops gold." Crest — Which is not recorded, but which appears on the seal, a mermaid holding in her dexter hand an anchor in pale cabled, without a beam, her sinister hand extended, holding a ball all proper. Motto — " Admorem villae de Poole."</p>
