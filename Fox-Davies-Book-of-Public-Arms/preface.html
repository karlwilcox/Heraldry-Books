<h1>PREFACE</h1>

<p class="intro-text">At the outset of these few pages, by way of introduction to this revised edition of 
my " Book of Public Arms," I wish to emphasise the keen and generous, and at the 
same time disinterested, interest which my publishers, Messrs T. C. &amp; E. C. Jack, 
have taken in the book. </p>

<p class="intro-text">The previous edition contained only the arms of Towns, Counties, and 
Universities. The additions to these categories alone in the intervening score of 
years would have justified a new edition from the mere consideration of available 
material. But as I wished to make the book as perfect as possible I decided, 
and Messrs Jack were agreeable, to extend the book so that it should- include 
every British impersonal coat of arms in existence. That meant adding the arms 
of Schools, Colleges, Societies, Trading Companies, Colonies, Hospitals, Episcopal 
Sees, etc., etc. That I have endeavoured to do, and the object in view in this edition 
has been to include every single coat of arms of an impersonal character. How far 
I have succeeded remains to be seen. Through the great kindness of Lyon King 
of Arms and Ulster King of Arms, who have both allowed me access to their 
records, I can confidently say that every genuine impersonal coat of arms included 
in their Scottish and Irish records will be found in this book. And let me here 
tender my grateful thanks for the assistance given me by Sir J. Balfour Paul, C.V.O., 
Lyon King of Arms, and Capt. Neville Wilkinson, C.V.O., Ulster King of Arms, 
and to F. J. Grant, Esq., Rothesay Herald and Lyon Clerk, and G. D. Burtchaell, 
Esq., Athlone Pursuivant of Arms, for the enormous help and assistance they have 
given me. I am, as my readers must be, very grateful to them. </p>

<p class="intro-text">Nobody is ever permitted the same facilities with regard to the College of Arms. 
The different constitution of that Corporation prevents it. But I have not met with 
any hindrance. Every help has been given me within the limits which are per- 
missible, every question I have asked any officer of arms has been answered, and 
I know many of the officers, and I have badgered my friends there to what I think 
must have been the limits of their patience. And I do wish to put on record that 
some of them — knowing I was engaged upon this book — when they have come 
across some strange coat which they have thought I might like to include have sent 
me the details unasked. I have had help there far beyond anything I expected or 
had a right to expect, and I most gratefully tender my thanks to all those at the 
College of Arms who have helped me. My debt to them is heavy. But I cannot 
guarantee I have everything from their records. There may still be treasure-trove 
for writers who follow me. I probably have got all the ancient grants, for Berry, the 
Registrar of the College of Arms at the close of the eighteenth century, gutted the 
Grant Books for his " Encyclopaedia Heraldica," and got sacked for doing so. Of the 
grants since Berry's time I am a bit doubtful that I have them all. I have written 
broadcast to every public body that I knew was using arms, or thought h'kely to 
be, and I cheerfully acknowledge the fact that very few of my letters have remained 
unanswered. There is none of the disinclination to give nie full details with regard 
to impersonal arms that I met with in the editing of my book " Armorial Families " 
and in the editing of" Burke's Landed Gentrj-," and I have nearly always been supplied 
at my request with full particulars and with the dates of grant. These details have all 
been checked at the College of Arms, and the information I print may be relied upon 
as far as it is humanly possible to guarantee work of mind and pen, both liable 
always to unintentional lapse into error. If the English impersonal coats in this book 
are not complete, I feel confident they are not far short of being so, and I am fairly 
confident that my book may also be entirely relied upon on the point of whether 
any given coat of arms is genuine or otherwise. I think I have every genuine impersonal 
coat of arms. I think I have, but I am not sure. At any rate I have done my best. 
Of the bogus impersonal coats I can only say I have included every one of which 
I have had knowledge, if it had serious claim to consideration. Bogus arms one can 
only deal with if one comes across them. Naturally there must be many of which 
I have never heard. </p>

<p class="intro-text">There is, however, one class of impersonal arms which I have entirely ignored. 
I refer to the arms of the ancient abbeys and other monastic establishments. They 
are all long since extinct, and any interest in them, if there be any, can be only of an 
entirely antiquarian character. Scores of them are recorded in some form or another 
in the College of Arms, but I know of no official formal record of a grant or con- 
firmation to any such body as an existing corporation. Such records as exist are 
incidental records of extinct bodies. There is scarcely a religious foundation to 
whicn there are not several coats of arms attributed. The whole subject is confusion, 
resulting from the painstaking attempts of bygone antiquaries to convert into coats 
of arms devices from seals. Some, of course, were used as and intended to be coats 
of arms. Some were purely personal to a particular individual. The bulk, I strongly 
believe, were never intended to be regarded as more than mere seal devices. It 
is impossible to get at the truth, and the truth, if it could be ascertained, matters 
so little that I have thought it wisest to leave the whole category alone. The 
information is seldom wanted, and the bulk of it is already in print for the use of 
students and inquirers. </p>

<p class="intro-text">In addition to the British coats to which I have alluded, this volume will be 
found to include many foreign coats of arms. As to these I do not pretend to the 
slightest knowledge whether they are genuine or bogus. I have made no attempt 
to verify them, and I accept no responsibility for them. I have tried to obtain 
correct information, and I have done the best I could to obtain the arms of all 
Foreign Countries, and of the Principal Foreign Cities. For foreign arms in the 
volume I make no higher claim. They are merely included in the hope 
that they may be useful to my readers, but I do not pretend that the in- 
formation I give concerning them even approximates in value to the information 
I give as to British arms. As to these I hope and believe the details may be 
absolutely relied upon. As to foreign arms I merely give the information as 
the best I can get. </p>

<p class="intro-text">Subject to the liability — a liability I personally am painfully conscious of — of 
all human work to carry the risk of error, I honestly believe my book may be 
depended upon as to the accuracy of the details of the arms and the statements 
of facts as to whether the arms are or are not recorded. The Scottish and Irish 
ones I speak of with confidence. I searched the registers myself, and, as to the 
Irish Records — some of which are far from being grant books — I had the invaluable 
assistance of Mr G. D. Burtchaell, Athlone Pursuivant of Arms. In Ireland, where 
Visitations were practically never made and where the registers of Ulster's Office 
before the eighteenth century admittedly might be more perfect, there is a tendency 
of thought which admits as proof of the right to arms many things such as draft 
grants and the private papers of dead and gone officers of arms to fill up possible 
gaps. To what extent such evidences are actually proof might be questioned were it 
not the habitual practice of Ulster's Office to stretch the point in their favour. I 
don't think that any Irish coat I have included is likely to be disallowed. In 
Scotland there is a hard and fast line. The Register is the register, and a coat is 
in it, or not in it. There is no half-way house, no matter what may be the value 
of various other records as proof of ancient user entitling a coat to be matriculated, 
and not granted, to win its way into the charmed circle of authorised arms. </p>

<p class="intro-text">With regard to the records of the College of Arms the position is this. There is 
a proper record by docquet or copy of grant of every coat of arms that has ever been 
granted by Letters Patent. I don't know exactly upon what basis of authority we 
find, as we do, records of most of the ancient impersonal arms in the Visitation Books. 
Most of the ancient City and Town arms which are genuine are to be found there, 
but I am bound to say that frequently the essence of the record seems to be the 
registration of the common seals of the Corporations rather than their arms. 
Where arms are recorded as arms, or where the device of the seal is plainly armorial 
and the tinctures are tricked, there is no difficulty, but there are one or two cases 
concerning which it is difficult to speak with assured certainty. The Visitation Books 
are official records, and a perfect record therein is, of course, conclusive admission of 
right. But there are of some coats of arms contemporary enrolments at the College 
of Arms in books which are neither grant books nor visitation books — books 
which are principally the painstaking work of bygone officers of arms, the records 
their industry created. Some, of course, can be dismissed at once as quite accurate 
but of no validating authority — evidence of user but not evidence of right. But 
there are one or two which cannot be lightly dismissed, and for that reason I would 
like to add the warning that I am not entirely certain as to all of the records, and 
though all of the coats which I state to be " recorded in the College of Arms " are 
so recorded, I cannot in every case in which I use the words guarantee the quality 
and authority and the validity of the particular book in which the record appears. 
Then there are a number of visitation records in which the arms without their 
tinctures are to be found. These are formally, I believe, held to be imperfect 
records. Then take such an example as the record of the arms of the Middle 
Temple. At the Visitation of the County of Northampton a family of the name 
of Temple exhibited and claimed the familiar cross and iamb. To that family the 
arms were disallowed, the reason entered in the Visitation Book being, " These be the 
arms of the Hon. Society of the Middle Temple." But there is no proper record of 
these arms to the Middle Temple, or of any of the arms of the Inns of Court, for 
the Inns of Court, not being Corporate Bodies, were not in the seventeenth century 
regarded as competent either to bear arms or receive a grant of arms. More recent 
precedents may have altered this, but in view of the facts, what is the value, as a 
determining factor of right or no right, of that entry in the Visitation of the County 
of Northampton ? I hold it is entirely negligible, but I am bound to add that a 
distinguished officer of arms has expressed to me the contrary opinion. I may 
perhaps add that this uncertainty does not arise as to personal arms. The officers 
of arms had powers of compulsion which they could and did apply to the individuals 
they summoned to attend them at the Visitations. The lists of "disclaimers" show 
how they did their work. I have never seen the name of a Corporate Body in the 
list of " disclaimers," and on that I base my belief in their exemption from compulsory 
appeai'ance. There has, of course, in bygone days quite as much as in modern times, 
been the home-made manufacture of coat-armour, but there has been an additional 
factor in respect of the arms of impersonal corporations. There has always been 
the desire to do honour to and to perpetuate the memory of the founder by the 
adoption of his arms. It is a highly laudable sentiment in the abstract, but in 
operative fact it is illegal. Suppose a School to commemorate its founder, the 
last Earl of X , were to style itself "The Earldom of X ." It would not be 
allowed a vote in the House of Lords. In the same way it would have no right 
to the arms of the Earl, which were probably granted by Patent with as definitely 
specified and as well understood a remainder as was his Peerage. </p>

<p class="intro-text">But there are scores of Colleges, Schools, and other-institutions which are sinning 
in this way, and as the use of the arms in many such cases goes back for a prolonged 
period, and as practically every such body so circumstanced before the Visitations 
was " allowed " the arms of the founder, I feel practically certain that if one joint 
petition were lodged by all the Schools and Colleges so circumstanced at the moment, 
praying that His Majesty would' be graciously pleased to issue His Royal Licence 
that they might continue to use the arms of their founders, that such a petition would 
be granted. There is, however, the further difficulty — e.g. the case of Harrow School 
— that in some cases the founders themselves had no right at all to the arms 
attributed to them. And I fancy a Royal Licence would hardly be granted in 
such a case as Shrewsbury, where the founder was a king, and the use of the Royal 
Arms would therefore be involved. </p>

<p class="intro-text">But Dulwich College and Charterhouse are cases in which 1 feel pretty certain 
a Royal Licence would be granted if it were applied for. </p>

<p class="intro-text">Grants of arms are never made in the ordinary way to Colonies. The arms 
of a Colony or of a self-governing Dominion are assigned by Royal Warrant under 
the Sign Manual of the Sovereign. Though there are certain fees payable upon 
the issue of such a warrant, it is nobody's business to initiate the application 
therefor, and these Colonial warrants have been sadly neglected. But another 
factor has been in existence. With that sublime interference with which one 
Government Department encroaches on another the Admiralty has published in 
the official book of authorised flags the devices for the various British territories 
beyond the seas which it considers suitable for use upon the flags of the 
Governors of the different Colonies. Most of these are wrong and usually ap- 
palling. Then in another direction we have the Mint supplying seals with devices 
more or less heraldic, and there has been always the native imagination inventing 
home-made coats of arms which found their way on to the official stationery and 
often even on to the coins and postage stamps. Then we even got to the length of 
the Colonial Office authorising a flag for Australia, which I have always thought 
was the extreme limit. The Royal Warrant assigning arms to any territory ought 
to have preceded the making of its first seal ; but the actual fact was that until a few 
years ago Jamaica, Gibraltar, Nova Scotia, Cape Colony, and Canada were the only 
Colonies which had genuine arms, whereas every Colony used something or other. </p>

<p class="intro-text">I hope I am not telling secrets when I say that it was no high-browed desire 
for righteousness which initiated the recent reform. As a matter of fact the require- 
ments of the Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace proved to be the 
operative factor. But I do want to enter my protest against the ghastly enormities 
which have been perpetrated by Royal Warrant under the guise of Colonial arms. 
The great bulk are appalling monstrosities. There is no other way of describing 
them. What could be worse, for instance, than the arms of the Leeward Islands? — 
and these are official. Some of the earlier Colonial arms — Jamaica, Nova Scotia, 
and Newfoundland — are arms to which no exception can be taken. The arms, 
moreover, granted in the reign of Queen Victoria to Canada and its Provinces, 
or to Cape Colony, are quite good. But there has recently been a large number of 
Warrants issued to Colonies. There seems to be about a large proportion a 
uniform level of artistic rottenness which surpasses all previous conception. The 
fault lies with the Colonies, which have insisted on the perpetuation of existing 
devices. </p>

<p class="intro-text">There are many Towns in the self-governing Dominions which are using bogus 
arms or have no authentic arms ; in fact, the only towns outside the United Kingdom 
to which grants have been made are: — Kingston (Jamaica), Bombay, Calcutta, Cape 
Town, Pretoria, Johannesburg, and Sydney. </p>

<p class="intro-text">Very few British counties have as yet obtained arms. In England it was held that 
nobody existed in a county competent to bear arms until the formation of the County 
Councils. In most cases the arms of the County Town did duty, but there were cases 
in which separate arms for the county were in use ; Middlese.x, Kent, and Surrey were 
instances. But since the formation of the County Councils several grants have been 
made. West Sussex was the first, Shropshire was the next ; then came Lancashire, 
Middlesex, Norfolk, and Somerset. The London County Council, after a particularly 
iniquitous heraldic career, has at last obtained a grant, no doubt because the 
fees were forthcoming from a private source, as indeed was the case with both 
West Sussex and Shropshire. </p>

<p class="intro-text">In Scotland arms were matriculated in 1500 for "the County of Perth" and in 
1890 "the Council of the County of Berwick." The only other county arms in that 
kingdom are those matriculated in 1889 by the Commissioners of Supply for the 
County of Renfrew. </p>

<p class="intro-text">There are no county arms in Ireland ; but arms for the four provinces of Ulster, 
Munster, Leinster, and Connaught officially exist, although one is puzzled to know 
to what or to whom they are assigned or by whom they are borne. </p>

<p class="intro-text">There has never been any objection raised to the granting of arms to Cities 
and Towns of a corporate nature, and at the present time grants are even 
being made to Urban District Councils, Erith and Twickenham being cases 
in point. </p>

<p class="intro-text">The next category of impersonal arms is to be found in those of the Episcopal 
and Archiepiscopal Sees. These call for little comment. It seems to be well 
established that the pallium stands for the status or rank of Archbishop rather 
than for any area of jurisdiction. Though the different archiepiscopal coats now 
have certain variations and are stereotyped into coats of arms, it is unlikely that 
these variations are in reality any more than former artistic differences of a universal 
type. The arms of the Anglican Episcopal Church Sees in Scotland and Ireland 
lapsed with the disestablishment of those churches, and the Welsh coats will follow 
suit. There would really seem no objection to a continuance of their use if a Royal 
Licence from His Majesty were to be obtained. By the conjunction of various sees 
the marshalling of the various coats would become necessary. With one or two 
exceptions the whole of the British Episcopal arms outside the United Kingdom 
are utterly bogus. A coat of arms is not a necessity, and if the Church desires 
that her Bishops should use impersonal arms upon their seals, it should take steps 
to have these properly called into being. </p>

<p class="intro-text">It should be noted that the mitre of a Bishop and an Archbishop are the same. 
The Bishop of Durham, and he alone, has the right to encircle the rim of his mitre 
with a coronet. </p>

<p class="intro-text">The rest of the impersonal arms call for little comment. Any corporate body 
having perpetual succession and a common seal have the right to obtain a grant 
of arms, and certainly arms exist in cases where this qualification is at any rate 
doubtful. Nowadays Schools, Colleges, Universities, Banks, Insurance Offices, and 
Railway Companies, Hospitals, and Charitable Societies are amongst those bodies 
which have obtained grants of arms. </p>

<p class="intro-text">The arms of the Livery Companies of London and other cities, a large pro- 
portion of which are quite genuine, present in different places a uniformity of motive 
which is puzzling, and at first sight apparently indicative of copying or usurpation. 
The real explanation, however, is to be found in the antecedent devices in general 
use as trade signs. Few have survived to the present day, though the barber's pole 
and the three balls of the pawnbroker are familiar to us all. In the same way the 
three escutcheons of the shield worker and painter were universal throughout Europe, 
and survive in the arms of the Painters and Paynter-Stayners Companies. These 
old trade devices, with more or less modification, have given the basis of design 
when by incorporation trade bodies have been called into being competent to receive 
grants or confirmations of arms. </p>

<p class="intro-text">It is a matter of considerable uncertainty what helmet shall be used with an 
impersonal coat of arms. Personally I myself think it is greatly to be regretted 
that any crest has ever been granted to an impersonal coat of arms. Impersonal 
arms originated either in territorial arms of sovereignty, in guild devices, or in flags. 
Putting aside the first-named, which so far as the Sovereign was concerned had 
a personal character, there was neither need, nor use, nor any reason for the 
existence of helmet or crest. None of the ancient impersonal arms had crests, and 
I am afraid it must be admitted that the beginnings of crests for impersonal coats 
lay in the desire of the Kings of Arms to grant them, but behind this desire lay, 
not the endeavour to extract fees, but the necessity of bringing corporations under 
their control, and I am confident that the bulk of these early grants of crests were 
nothing more than the bait to tempt corporations to acknowledge authority and 
record the arms they were using. The grant of the crest created the opportunity of 
recording and confirming the arms. The earliest of such grants date from the fifteenth 
century, a period before rank was denoted by the style and shape of the helmet. I 
know of no rules and can simply state the facts within my knowledge. With regard 
to the arms of Colonies, very few date back to the Stuart period. I have never seen 
a Royal Warrant of this period for the purpose. I very much doubt if an original is 
still in existence, but arms of Colonies which are of ancient origin appear always to 
be represented with the Royal helmet. This, one would imagine, is correct; there is 
certainly no reason why any other helmet should be used. But the majority of 
Colonial arms are quite modern. I can call nothing to mind granted between the 
reign of Charles II. and the reign of Queen Victoria. The modern Colonial warrants 
have no helmet and mantling either painted upon them or recited in the wording of 
the warrant. A number of them certainly have crests, but these are simply placed 
on wreaths above the escutcheon without any intervening helmet or mantling. From 
these facts, the conclusion I draw is, that the correct helmet and mantling for 
a colony should be that of the Sovereign, and I shall adhere to that opinion until 
I come across an actual warrant which uses a different helmet. With regard to the 
arms of counties, it should be remembered that until the passing of the act creating 
County Councils there was no body in any county competent to bear arms or to 
obtain a grant of arms. But in Scotland at any rate a grant had been made to 
" The County of Perth " and to the commissioners of supply for the County of 
Renfrew. These grants I have always doubted the real validity of, but they exist. 
Perth, though it has a crest, was emblazoned without a helmet. Berwick had no 
crest, but Renfrew was emblazoned with the helmet of an esquire. The English 
counties, of course, had no arms, but in one or two cases — for example, Kent and 
Middlesex — arms had by long repute been attributed to counties, but in no case 
was there any reputation of a crest, and so the question of the helmet did not 
arise. After the passing of the County Councils Act the first council in England 
to obtain a grant for the county was West Sussex : that had no crest and con- 
sequently no helmet. The next was Shropshire, which likewise and very 
properly was also without a crest; and it would have been well if these two 
precedents had stereotyped the absence of a crest as proper to the arms of 
a county. The next county to obtain a grant was Lancashire, which in the 
pride of its wealth went for arms, crest, and supporters. In this grant the 
helmet was that of an esquire, and this grant for England, and the grant to 
Renfrew for Scotland, have fixed and determined the rule that the proper 
helmet for a county is that of an esquire. I presume it would be the same 
for Ireland, but there is nothing in the nature of arms for a county in the 
kingdom of Ireland. With regard to the arms of cities and towns, for some 
utterly inexplicable reason the right to a knight's helmet is always conceded 
to any Scottish city or town when it matriculates its arms ; but in England the 
helmet for a city or town is always that of an esquire. With regard to other 
corporate bodies who obtain grants of arms, the rule when a crest is granted is 
that the helmet shall be that of an esquire, and this rule nowadays is always 
strictly adhered to ; but many grants in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries — 
for example, to City Livery Companies — were unquestionably emblazoned with 
the helmet of a peer. I should myself have been inclined to regard these as 
examples of the use of helmets before any rules concerning them had been devised, 
were it not that Sir Albert Woods, Garter King of Arms, who, whatever his artistic 
faults, and they were many, was meticulously accurate in these matters of detail, 
certified the arms of the Goldsmiths' Company under a painting which distinctly 
showed the helmet of a peer. This may have been intentional, for a number of 
the mantlings of the arms of these City Companies are lined with ermine. Where 
I have known this to be the case I have noted this in the blazons. No university 
ever had a crest until the grant in 1905 to the University of Leeds, which was 
followed by a similar grant to the University of Wales. The emblazonments of 
these grants, I understand, do not show any helmet or mantling. I think it is a 
thousand pities that the tradition that no university has a crest should be broken 
— universities are amongst the very few grants in which the motto forms a part of 
the grant — but as it has been broken, one can only say that there is no reason 
for supposing that the helmet can be anything but that of an ordinary esquire. 
The only exception to these rules as to the use of helmets lies in the usage by the 
City of London of the helmet of a peer. This is not a usage for which there is a 
trace of official authority, and this point is dealt with under the arms of London. </p>

<p class="intro-text">The only cities which to my knowledge have ever used a fur cap over the shield 
of arms are London, Dublin, York, and Norwich. Of York I can say nothing 
beyond the fact that in many representations of the arms I have seen the fur cap. 
The arms of Norwich are seldom represented without it, and in Norwich the fur cap, 
which in this case is black, was formerly worn by the Mayor himself. In London the 
fur cap is actually worn by the sword-bearer, and there is nothing to show that it was 
ever worn by the Mayor ; in fact, the evidence is to the contrary. The earliest instance 
in which it is found is a case about the year 1677, where it figures, not over the shield, 
but in a background of miscellaneous municipal insignia. I believe it is there 
intended to indicate the cap of the London apprentice, and I am strongly of opinion, 
that if we had any certain knowledge, it would, in the case of London, be traceable 
to such an origin ; possibly through a mistaken imitation of the case at Norwich, 
where there would appear to be some real reason and foundation for its use. But 
there is not a trace of any official sanction for the use of such an embellishment by 
any English town. The case of Dublin is rather different. I am not quite sure who 
actually wears the garment there, but the late Ulster King of Arms, Sir Arthur 
Vicars, K.C.V.O., wrote to me that he would have no hesitation in certifying the 
arms of the City of Dublin with this cap, and for that reason it is included, as it is 
used, in the illustration. Whether or not the present Ulster King of Arms holds the 
same view I am quite unaware, but there "certainly is nothing in the way of authority 
at present officially recorded for it. It is worthy of note that none of the cities I 
have mentioned have any crest, consequently there is no reason for helmet or 
mantling to surmount the arms, and the absence of one may account for the 
presence of the other. The City of London, after, even for official purposes, making 
great use for the last hundred years of the fur cap, has now decided to discourage 
its use, and prefer on all occasions its bogus crest. </p>

<p class="intro-text">Widespread as is the use of the mural crown in connection with municipal arms, 
there was, until a few months ago, no authority whatever for its use in this country. 
Since the seventeenth century and its haphazard granting of personal crests upon 
caps of maintenance and out of coronets passed away, there was until quite recently 
an unwritten law and a rigidly enforced practice that the mural crown should be 
exclusively reserved for grants of crests to officers of the army of the rank of General, 
and for such cases the mural crown has been religiously reserved. On the Continent 
however, it has always been regarded as a regular adjunct of a civic coat of arms, 
some writers even elaborating rules as to the number of turrets and towers to be 
included in the crown according to the rank and character of the town as a Royal 
residence, capital city, fortified town, or otherwise. I doubt if these regulations have 
any real authority, but one does come across them conscientiously asserted, but they 
had no acceptance whatever in England, Scotland, or Ireland, where the rule held 
which I have quoted. This rule, however, has now gone by the board, for Lyon King 
of Arms, in the exercise of his discretion, but which I cannot but think was a very 
unfortunate decision, has matriculated in his register the arms of both Paisley and 
St Andrews, the escutcheon in each case being surmounted by a mural crown. To 
Lyon King of Arms and his fearless refusal to be bound by convention the 
heraldry of to-day owes much, and how much the future only will reveal, but I cannot 
help regretting this decision of his, because it smashes a very cherished privilege of 
army grants. Had Lyon, following the continental practice, introduced the walled 
and turreted crown one meets with in Germany, the matter might have been 
different, but he has matriculated the army crown pure and simple. This bad 
example has now been followed by the College of Arms, for in the grant of arms 
to the London County Council a mural crown is included. In this case it was done 
by Royal Licence. It is to be hoped that Germany will not regard this crown as 
evidence of the fortification of London. </p>

<p class="intro-text">In the use of supporters with impersonal arms opinion has changed. Supporters 
(but not those now in use) can be found in conjunction with the arms of the City of 
London at a period when it is at any rate doubtful whether heraldic supporters were 
fully established as part of an achievement. Supporters to the arms of the Livery 
Companies are found very earl)', but they were not usual with the arms of cities and 
towns until the seventeenth century. But for a long period an idea held in England, 
and was uniformly acted upon, that supporters were the sign of a city and could not 
be granted to a town of lesser degree. A careful examination of precedents has 
shown that there is no authority or foundation for such a supposed rule, and as far as 
I am aware supporters will now be granted to any impersonal coat of arms on payment 
of the usual fees. They certainly have been granted to some colonies, many cities, 
some towns, some counties, and a large number of institutions and corporate bodies. 
But I do not know of any instance of supporters being granted to an episcopal coat, 
a university, a school, or a railway company. Before leaving supporters a passing 
reference perhaps may be made to the single supporters which occur in the arms of 
the Swiss Cantons, the City of Perth, and the Burgh of Falkirk. The blazon of this 
latter coat, and that of the Royal Warrant to the Bermudas, are rather typical of the 
differing Scottish and English methods of dealing with the same situation. </p>

<p class="intro-text">With regard to wreaths, one can only say the usual heraldic practices are 
generally adopted, although the City of Chester gives us an example of a wreath and 
mantling each of three colours, and in the cases of one or two of the City Livery 
Companies the colours are exceptional. </p>

<p class="intro-text">Augmentations in the case of impersonal arms are rare. The arms of London- 
derry and Hereford are instances however, and I cannot but think it would be a 
happy proceeding if the sieges of Ladysmith and of Mafeking were commemorated 
by augmentations. </p>

<p class="intro-text">The resuscitation in recent years of the old practice of assigning badges and 
standards has in a few cases already spread to impersonal arms. Launceston was 
the first, and Nottingham, Llanelly, and the Port of London Authority have since 
followed suit. </p>

<p class="intro-text">Probably by far the most important alteration that has taken place since the 
previous edition was published has been the authorisation of arms for Wales, which 
is presumably a consequence of the Royal Warrant declaring the arms of the 
Prince of Wales, which has substituted the arms attributed to Llewellyn, and borne 
by Owen Glendower, for the inescutcheon of Saxony, which most of the descendants 
of the late Prince Consort bear upon their arms. </p>

<p class="intro-text">In addition to the arms of Colonies which are assigned by Royal Warrant, this 
method of calling arms into being has been followed in the cases of the County of 
Norfolk, the County of London, the City of Cardiff, the Port of London Authority, 
and several others. The reason is usually, if not always, to be found in the desire 
to include the whole or some part of the Royal Arms. </p>

<p class="intro-text">The years which followed the publication of the original edition of my book 
contributed, muchly to my everlasting amusement, to the showers of abuse which fell 
upon me for calling attention to the bogus character of many impersonal coats 
of arms. Many towns which I then criticised are now pursuing the paths of heraldic 
virtue. But there are still many spurious coats of arms in use, and one cannot help 
wondering whether it might not be possible to put some of these right by private 
initiative. The chairmen of at least two County Councils paid the fees for grants 
of arms to their counties. The old scholars of a famous Scottish School collected 
the cost of a matriculation of arms. The fees on a recent grant to a famous old 
town were raised by private subscription. I know of a number of such cases, and 
would myself cheerfully subscribe to the fees for grants of arms to be made to the 
Boroughs of Much Wenlock, Cardigan, and Carmarthen, and to the Honourable 
Society of Lincoln's Inn, with all of which I have personal associations. Also would 
I subscribe to get the arms matriculated which have been in use by Inveraray and 
New Galloway. I have never been near either place, and don't know that I want 
to go, but the two coats of arms interest me, particularly the alleged Inveraray arms, 
and I want to see what Lyon King of Arms would do with them and what Ulster 
will do with the arms of Waterford. I never had any very high opinion of the 
Society of Antiquaries. But it would really give me pleasure to subscribe to a fund 
to get the Society a genuine coat of arms and bring to a close the scandal of its 
present heraldic criminality. </p>

<p class="intro-text">There are still several colonies which need Royal Warrants to be issued for 
the assigning of arms to them, and I would like to see arms assigned by warrant to 
Rhodesia, with authority for them to be placed on a monument to the memory of 
Cecil Rhodes, and to be borne by the Rhodes family. India and her Provinces 
have no arms, the City of London will not see the error of her ways ; Newport, 
Swansea, and Carnarvon have all yet to learn righteousness. The Counties and 
the Episcopal Sees are hotbeds of heraldic iniquity. </p>

<p class="intro-text">In twenty years one's friends and correspondents change, and the list of those 
to whom herein I make my acknowledgments of indebtedness for assistance is a 
different list from the one which figured in my first edition. To those whose names 
I then gave my indebtedness still remains, and is remembered with gratitude for 
the help which then enabled me to call this book into being. </p>
