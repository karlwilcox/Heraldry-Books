<p class="content"><span class="entry">READING </span>(Berkshire). (Azure), five heads in saltire couped at the neck (proper crined or), the centre head ducally crowned (of the last).</p>
<p class="content"> According to Berry, these arms were granted by Camden, Clarenceux King of Arms, in the year 1566, and subsequently confirmed by Hervey, Clarenceux King of Arms ; but Berry states that the centre head is between the letters R and E, and Debrett's " House of Commons " so gives it. The entry made at the time of visitations is simply a drawing of the seal, which shows the five heads in saltire without any tinctures being marked, and having the legend,</p>
<pre class="quotation">
"Communitatis Radingie," but the said drawing is distinctly labelled, " These are the Armes apperteyninge," etc.
</pre>
<p class="content"> The arms," Azure, three escallop-shells or,"-have frequently been attributed to the town, but these are the arms of Reading Abbey. The escallop-shell in the remote ages was the peculiar badge of a " palmer," and it is a curious coincidence that to a family of the name of " Palmer" Reading should owe so much of its present prosperity.</p>
