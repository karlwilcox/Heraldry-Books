<p class="content"><span class="entry">SAFFRON WALDEN </span>(Essex). Has no armorial bearings. It represents a castle in base, and in fesse two towers all joined with a circular wall embattled, and in the centre of the seal three saffron flowers slipped and leaved, with the legend, " Sigillum Comunis Villae de Walden in Comitatu Essex."</p>
