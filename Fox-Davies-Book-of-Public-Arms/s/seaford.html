<p class="content"><span class="entry">SEAFORD </span>(Sussex). Has no armorial bearings. Two seals are recorded in the College of Arms. The larger bears upon its obverse a bird regardant with wings endorsed, and the legend " Sigillum burgensium de Saefordia"; and upon the reverse, upon waves of the sea a three-masted ship, the sail on the main-mast set and on the others furled, and each having a pennon, with the legend "With Suttonij et Chyngton." The smaller seal has an eagle displayed looking to the sinister, with the legend " Sigillum Balivi de Sa^ford." Berry seems to have confused the two seals.</p>
