<p class="content"><span class="entry">SELKIRK </span>(Selkirkshire). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. The various seals all represent the Holy Virgin with her Child seated on a throne, trees growing from behind the throne, and at her feet an escutcheon charged with the Royal Arms of Scotland. Upon the Town-Clerk's notepaper a similiar design appears, but clouds are substituted for the trees, and in place of the legend is the Motto â€” " Et spreta incolvmem vita defendere famam."</p>
