<p class="content"><span class="entry">SKINNERS </span>(Edinburgh). Berry in his description of the arms on the Gold Medal of the Deacon-Convener of the Corporate Bodies of Trades in Edinburgh (refer sub Edinburgh) gives for the Skinners "party per fesse gules and argent, a pale counterchanged, on the first, three goats salient of the second." But these arms so closely resemble the arms of the Glovers of London that perhaps Berry is wrong and that the arms used by the Skinners of Edinburgh are really the ne.xt coat, " ermine, on a chief gules, three imperial crowns proper," which he assigns to the Furriers of Edinburgh, but which are identical with the arms of the Skinners of London and the United Glovers and Skinners of Exeter. [No arms are matriculated in Lyon Register. Refer sub Edinburgh.]</p>
