<p class="content"><span class="entry">TENBY </span>(Pembrokeshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal represents a building of some kind, and above is an escutcheon, the chief barry of four charged with three martlets, two and one, and in base a like number of cinquefoils, also two and one, with the legend " Sigillum comune burgensium ville tenebie." Appended is a copy of a letter which I have received from the Town-Clerk in relation to the matter.</p>
<pre class="quotation">
" As requested, I send herewith impression from the Tenby Borough Seal, also a sketch of the original Seal, which has been lost for some years. The small Brass Common Seal of the Borough (. . .) has also been missing for some years, so that the only Seal now in use is the Mayor's Seal, and a smaller size of same for small documents."
