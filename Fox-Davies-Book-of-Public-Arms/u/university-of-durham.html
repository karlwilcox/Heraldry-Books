<p class="content"> [These arms are recorded in the College of Arms. Gts., xlvi. 309.] The cross as used is by no means a true cross patt6e, but I know of no better heraldic description for it, though I believe it is known as the cross of St Cuthbert. The arms upon the canton are those of Bishop Hatfield. Bishop Hatfield's Hall makes use of the arms as upon the canton with the Motto — " Vel primus vel cum primis."</p>
