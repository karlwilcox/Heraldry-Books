<p class="content"><span class="entry">WALES </span>(Principality of). DiiTerent royal arms borne by the various rulers are of course in existence and well known, notably those of North Wales, South Wales, and Powysland. Those of the first, which are those borne in the thirteenth century by lorwerth Drwyndwh and by the Princes of Wales till the last Prince Llewellyn, and assumed as the arms of Wales by Owen Glendwr, are however almost universally used and quoted, when Wales as a principality requires to be heraldically represented, and are quarterly or and gules four lions passant guardant counter-changed. These arms have had some official recognition as the arms of Wales since the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and by a Royal Warrant, dated 1912, are now borne by the Prince of Wales on an inescutcheon in the centre of his arms. The badge of Wales is " on a mount vert, a dragon passant gules," and is borne by the King and (differenced by a label of three points argent) by the Prince of Wales.</p>
