<p class="content"><span class="entry">WALSALL </span>(Staffordshire). Has no armorial bearings. Those in use constitute a decidedly peculiar achievement. The arms of France and England quarterly answer the purpose of an escutcheon. This is surmounted by a coronet, composed of five fleurs-de-!ys, and therein a mount surmounted by a bear sejant erect, collared and chained, and holding between his forepaws a ragged staff". For Supporters â€” Two lions sejant guardant, addorsed {i.e. with the escutcheon resting upon their backs), the tails interlaced below the escutcheon. The Corporation seal shows the foregoing arms and supporters surmounted by an open coronet, the rim surmounted by five fleurs-de-lys.</p>
