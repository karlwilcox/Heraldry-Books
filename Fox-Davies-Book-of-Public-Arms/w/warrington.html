Crest — On a wreath of the colours, upon a rock proper, a Unicorn rampant argent, armed, maned, and unguled, supporting a flagstaff all or, thereon hoisted a flag flying to the sinister, per pale argent and azure charged with a rose gules, barbed and seeded of the first, and a garb of the second.

<p class="content"> [Granted by Sir Albert Woods, Garter; G. E. Cokayne, Clarenceux; and William H. Weldon, Norroy, i8th May 1897. The grant is printed in extenso in the Genealogical Magazine, September 1897, vol. i. p. 259. The lioncels were suggested by the arms of Paganus de Villars, and the covered cups by the arms of the Boteler or Butler family. The rose and garb in the crest allude to the fact that at the time of its incorporation Warrington was partly in Lancashire and partly in Cheshire. The unicorn is also suggested by the crest of the Boteler family. (<a href="../a/arch-treasurer-of-the-holy-roman-empire.html">See a letter in the Genealogical Magazine, p</a>. 430.)</p>
