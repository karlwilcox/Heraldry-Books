<p class="content"><span class="entry">WATERFORD, </span>City of (Co. Waterford). Has no armorial bearings recorded in Ulster's Office, but Burke gives in his " General Armory " : " Per fesse gu. and ar., in chief three lions pass, guard, in pale or, in base on the sea ppr. three barks of the third. Crest — A lion sejant supporting an Irish harp or. Supporters — (Dexter) a lion or ; (sinister) a dolphin ar. Motto — ' Urbs intacta manet.'"</p>
<p class="content"> These arms are on the charter (.^), and are noted by the Smith, Rouge Dragon, 1613.</p>
<p class="content"> In Debrett's " House of Commons " the illustration of the arms of Waterford differs slightly. The shield is shown party per fesse, but the tinctures of both chief and base are vert, which is obviously wrong, and only one ship is sliowrTm base, and that with two masts.</p>
