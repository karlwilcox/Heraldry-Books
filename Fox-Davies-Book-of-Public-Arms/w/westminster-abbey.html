<p class="content"><span class="entry">WESTMINSTER ABBEY </span>(The Abbey Church of St Peter). Crockford assigns to Westminster Abbey the arms of the ancient See of Westminster, to which refer ; but Woodward gives an additional coat, " Azure, on a chief indented or the head of a pastoral staff and a mitre gules." This last coat is recorded in the College of Arms.</p>
