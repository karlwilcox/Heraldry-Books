<p class="content"><span class="entry">WINCHESTER </span>(Sussex). Has no armorial bearings. Those in use, which are quoted in Burke's " General Armory," are Party per pale gules and azure, three demi-lions passant guardant or, conjoined in pale to the hulks of as many ships argent. Berry gives a note, " This borough hath also a very ancient Seal, representing a ship with a castle at the head and another at the stern, and on one part of the Seal is a small escocheon of the Arms of England, viz., three lions in pale."</p>
