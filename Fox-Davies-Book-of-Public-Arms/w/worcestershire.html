<p class="content"><span class="entry">WORCESTERSHIRE. </span>Has no armorial bearings. Owing to the uncertainty which has existed as to the arms of the City of Worcester (to which refer), many variations upon the one or the other of the coats, or upon both, have been used, but the seal of the County Council simply exhibits the arms, " Argent, a fesse between three pears sable," which now appear (and more is the pity) to be generally accepted as the county arms â€” witness the labels on the Worcestershire sauce bottles.</p>
