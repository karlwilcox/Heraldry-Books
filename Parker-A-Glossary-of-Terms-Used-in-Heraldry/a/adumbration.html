<h1>Adumbration</h1>
<p>Adumbration, or Transparency: the shadow of a charge, apart from the charge itself, painted the same <a  href="../c/colours.html">colour</a> as the <a  href="../f/field.html">field</a> upon which it is placed, but of a darker tint, or perhaps, in outline only. The term belongs rather to the romance of heraldry than to its practice, and is imagined by the writers to have been adopted by families who, having lost their possessions, and consequently being unable to maintain their dignity, chose rather to <a  href="../b/bear.html">bear</a> their hereditary arms adumbrated than to relinquish them altogether. When <a  href="../f/figured.html">figured</a> by a <a  href="../b/black.html">black</a> line the bearing is said to be entrailed.</p>
