<h1>Arrow</h1>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/022a.png" alt="STANDARD." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">STANDARD.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Arrow, (fr. fl&ecirc;che): the ordinary position of an arrow is in pale, with the <a  href="../p/point.html">point</a> downward, that is, falling(fr. tombante), but to prevent the possibility of a mistake, it would be better always to mention it, because in French coats they are more frequently the other way. When represented as <a  href="../r/rising.html">rising</a>, it should be stated "with <a  href="../p/point.html">point</a> upwards," &amp;c. Arrows appear blazoned as <a  href="../b/barbed.html">barbed</a>(fr. ferr&eacute;) or armed(fr. arm&eacute;) of the tincture of their points, and flighted or feathered(fr. empenn&eacute;) of that of their feathers; also notched(or nooked) (fr. encoch&eacute;) of the tincture of the end which <a  href="../r/rest.html">rests</a> on the bowstring. The <a  href="../t/tincture.html">tincture</a> given is that of the shaft, but with French heralds it is sometimes named as <a  href="../s/shafted.html">shafted</a>(fr. <a  href="../f/fute.html">fut&eacute;</a>) of such a tincture.</p>
<blockquote>

<p class="blazon">When <a href="../a/arrow.html">arrows</a> are in bundles such bundles are called <a  href="../s/sheaves-of-arrows.html">sheaves of arrows</a>(the number and position being in some cases mentioned).</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">A <a  href="../b/birdbolt.html">bird-bolt</a> again differs, not being barbed as an <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">ordinary</a> <a href="../a/arrow.html">arrow</a>: it may be described as a blunt-headed arrow used to shoot birds, and shot from a cross-bow. An old French word, 'boson,' also occurs, which appears to mean the same.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">A broad arrow differs somewhat, perhaps, from the above in the head, and resembles a pheon(q.v.), except in the omission of the jagged edge on the inside of the barbs. By the term broad arrow, the head alone is meant. The <a  href="../b/bolt.html">bolt</a> and the quarrel were shorter arrows, used with the cross-bow.</p>
