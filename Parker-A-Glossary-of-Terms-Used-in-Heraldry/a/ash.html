<h1>Ash</h1>
<p>Ash: this tree occurs in more than one coat, rather, perhaps, in consequence of the frequency of the syllable ash in proper names. It probably refers to the common <a href="../a/ash.html">ash</a>(i.e. fraxinus), unless otherwise expressed. But examples occur of mountain ash, properly called the <a  href="../r/rowan-tree.html">rowan-tree</a>(and in one case rodey).</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, an ash-tree proper issuing from the bung of a tun--ASHTON, Cornwall.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, an ash-tree vert--ESTWREY. [By one branch of the family a chevron vert between three bunches of ashen keys proper.]</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, on a chevron gules between three branches of rowan[or rodey] tree proper, as many crescents or. [Also by another blazoning between three trees proper, fructed of the second]--RODEY, Liverpool.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, on a chevron azure, between three branches of mountain-ash vert, as many crescents of the first--ROWNTREE.</p>
