<h1>Axe</h1>
<p>Axe, (fr. hache): there are various kinds of <a href="../a/axe.html">axes</a> and hatchets. It is impossible to classify them, or give the whole of the varieties; but the following will be found the <a  href="../c/chief.html">chief</a> forms which appear. The handle of the axe is sometimes called the stave, or an axe may be <a  href="../h/hafted.html">hafted</a>(fr. <a  href="../m/manche.html">manch&eacute;</a>), and the blade is often referred to.</p>

<p class="blazon">9. The Danish axe was probably so called because it occurred in the royal arms of that kingdom, in which it is drawn like a <a  href="../l/lochabar-axe.html">Lochabar axe</a>, but some apply the named to an axe whose blade is notched at the back. There is a form without the notch borne by HAKELUT, and called a <a  href="../d/danish-hatchet.html">Danish hatchet</a>. The <a  href="../i/indian.html">Indian</a> <a  href="../t/tomahawk.html">tomahawk</a> occurs in the arms of HOPKINS, granted 1764.</p>
