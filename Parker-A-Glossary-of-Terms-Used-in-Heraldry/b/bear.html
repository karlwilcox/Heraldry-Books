<h1>Bear</h1>
<p>Bear, (fr. ours): frequent in German arms, and in some instances in Scottish arms, but comparatively rare in English arms, though not unfrequent as a <a  href="../c/crest.html">crest</a>, and sometimes the <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a> or jambs are chosen for the latter apart from the body. In one coat of arms Sea-bears are named: it is not clear what is meant, possibly Seals, but more probably Polar-bears. The <a  href="../c/canton.html">Canton</a> of Berne in Switzerland, as well as the <a  href="../a/abbey.html">Abbey</a> of S.Gall, exhibit the bear in their insignia. Bears appear also as <a  href="../s/supporters.html">supporters</a>.</p>
