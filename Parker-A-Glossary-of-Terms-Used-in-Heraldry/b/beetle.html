<h1>Beetle</h1>
<p>Beetle: possibly this is but an error of some writer, who has mistaken the flies for beetles(as the name of the bearer suggests); however, the stag beetles(lucanid&oelig;Â“ of naturalists) occur.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron vert between three beetles proper--MUSCHAMP.</p>
<p class="blazon">Per pale gules and azure, three stag beetle's wings extended or--DOORE, Cornwall.</p>
