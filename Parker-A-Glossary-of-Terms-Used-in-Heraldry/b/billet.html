<p>Billet, (fr. billette): a small oblong figure. In architecture blocks of a similar shape bear this name, and are frequent in Ionic and Corinthian, and are continued Norman, mouldings; but while they are in architecture either exact square or else cylindrical, in heraldry they are brick-shaped, and should be drawn twice as <a  href="../l/long.html">long</a> as wide. The theory that it was meant to represent a written <a  href="../l/letters.html">letter</a>(i.e. modern French 'billet') will scarcely bear examination. The term rarely appears in ancient rolls as a separate charge, but often under the term <a href="../b/billetty.html">billette</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Or, three billets gules--MERLING.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, ten billets, 4, 3, 2, and 1 or, within a bordure engrailed argent, charged with ten torteaux--SALTER.</p>
<p class="blazon">Monsire Bartholomew GABRIEL, or, a vi billetts sable--Roll, temp. ED. III.</p>

<a id="061"></a><p class="blazon">They are not always straight-sided, being sometimes raguled, and this possibly illustrates the original meaning, namely, that they were blocks of wood cut with the <a href="../b/bill.html">bill</a>, or <a  href="../w/woodman.html">woodman's</a> <a  href="../a/axe.html">axe</a>. An example of a carved stone billet also occurs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a billet, raguled and trunked sable, inflamed in three places proper--BILLETTES.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three stone billets carved gules--BILLERBERG.</p>
