<h1>Blood-colour</h1>
<p>Blood-colour: the term Bloody, which occurs at times in the works of some old heraldic writers(as a bloody hand, heart, &amp;c.) does not seem to signify <a  href="../s/sanguine.html">sanguine</a> but gules. The Latin blodius also is probably to be interpreted the same, though there are instances in which blodius is presumed to be used for 'blue,' i.e. <a  href="../a/azure.html">azure</a>.</p>
