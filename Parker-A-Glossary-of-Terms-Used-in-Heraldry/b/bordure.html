<p>Bordure, (fr.) or Border: this bearing, which is reckoned among the sub-ordinaries, occupies one-fifth of the field. It is generally used as the mark of a younger branch of a family. Charged bordures in ancient armoury are supposed to allude to maternal descent. In some cases they are possibly augmentations. It is, however, evident from the bordure being sometimes the only charge in a coat, that it is a distinct and original bearing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Ermine, a bordure gules--HUNDESCOTE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, a bordure vair--GWINE, or GYNES.</p>
<p class="blazon">Ermine, a bordure compony or and sable--RENDELL, Harl. MS., 1441.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The <a href="../b/bordure.html">bordure</a> is placed over all ordinaries, except the chief, the quarter, and the canton, which invariably surmount it, with perhaps some few exceptions, which are in such cases to be specially described.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a chief paly of six gules and or within a bordure engrailed sable--KEITH, Scotland.</p>
<p class="blazon">Quarterly gules and or a bordure counterchanged; over all a chevron vair--FENWYKE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="blazon">When a coat having a <a href="../b/bordure.html">bordure</a> is impaled with another coat the bordure may be omitted where they join. [See <a  href="../i/impaling.html">Impaling</a>.] If it charged with eight bezants(for example) only three whole ones will be seen, and two halves. Quartered coats, on the other hand, should retain their bordures entire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Quarterly, first and fourth France and England quartered within a bordure argent; second and third or, a chevron gules--STAFFORD, Duke of Buckingham.</p>
</blockquote>
<a id="074"></a><p class="blazon">When a <a href="../b/bordure.html">bordure</a> is bezant&eacute;, billett&eacute;, or the like, the number of bezants or billets is generally eight, unless some other number is particularized. The <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of Richard, King of the Romans, are represented sometimes with eight, sometimes with more, bezants, q.v.</p>

<p class="blazon">The line of the <a href="../b/bordure.html">bordure</a> may be <a  href="../i/indented.html">indented</a>(e.g. DE VERE), wavy, embattled, engrailed, recersel&eacute;, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="blazon">It may also be <a  href="../c/chequy.html">chequy</a> <a  href="../l/lozengy.html">lozengy</a>, <a  href="../v/vair.html">vair</a>, and the like.</p>

<p class="blazon">A <a href="../b/bordure.html">bordure</a> <a  href="../c/compony.html">compony</a> should consist of sixteen pieces. It was supposed to have been a mark of illegitimacy, in cases where a natural son has succeeded by bequest to the estates of his father.</p>

The <a  href="../w/word.html">word</a> is probably only a corruption of the French en orle.</p>
<p class="blazon">Analogous to the above is the Bordure entoyer or entier: charged with eight figures of any kind, except animals or plants, and Bordure verdoy, charged with eight leaves of flowers.</p>

<p class="blazon">The <a href="../b/bordure.html">Bordure</a> of <a  href="../f/france.html">France</a> is azure, charged with eight fleurs-de-lis or: and the Bordure of Scotland is the double tressure flory counter flory gules, or more probably, a bordure or, charged with such a tressure.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a href="../b/bordure.html">bordure</a> has no diminutive, but it is said that one may be <a  href="../s/surmounted-by.html">surmounted by</a> another of half its width. It is not the same as the <a  href="../o/orle.html">Orle</a>, though so used by some writers.</p>
