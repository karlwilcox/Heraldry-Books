<h1>Bream</h1>
<p>Bream, and sea-bream: these appear to be two different kinds of <a  href="../f/fish.html">fish</a>; the former, or carp-bream, as it is called(cyprinus of Linn&aelig;us, and abramis of later naturalists), is a fish which inhabits rivers and lakes, and in some districts is plentiful. The latter is the marine fish of that name(sparus of Linn&aelig;us, pagrus vulgaris of later writers), and is said to be taken frequently in the Mediterranean by anglers. The <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of Doxey are often, however, blazoned as "three hakes."</p>
