<h1>Canting Arms</h1>
<p>Canting Arms(sometimes called allusive or punning arms, and by French heralds, armes parlantes) are very generally distributed. They are arms containing charges which are allusive to the name of the bearer. A few examples are annexed.</p>

</blockquote>
<a id="089"></a><p class="blazon">Many even of early coats of arms allude, in some way or other, to the names of their bearer, and perhaps more than is commonly suspected would be found to be so, if we could always recover the early chance names given to the <a href="../c/charge.html">charges</a> of which they are composed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Geoffrey de LUCY, de goules a trois lucies d'or--Roll, temp. HEN. III.</p>
<p class="blazon">Nicholas de MOELES, d'argent a deux barres de goules, a trois molets en le chief de goules--Ibid.</p>
<p class="blazon">Thomas CORBETT, d'or deux carbeaux noir--Ibid.</p>
<p class="blazon">Roger de MERLEY, barree d'argent et de goulz, a la bordur d'azure, et merlots d'or en la bordur--Ibid.</p>
<p class="blazon">Odinel HERON d'azur a trois herons d'argent--Ibid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon"><a  href="../a/armes-parlantes.html">Arms parlantes</a> do not often occur of later date than King James I., about which time they began to grow into disrepute from ignorance and misapplication, and were nick-named canting or punning arms. They were numerous at all preceding periods, not only in England, but throughout Christendom.</p>
