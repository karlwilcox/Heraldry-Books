<h1>Cap</h1>
<p>Cap: the principal caps in use as <a href="../c/charge.html">charges</a>, parts of crests, or accessories to coats of arms, are the following:</p>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/091c.png" alt="Lord Mayor's Cap." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Lord Mayor's Cap.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="blazon">The Lord Mayor's <a href="../c/cap.html">cap</a> usually placed over the insignia of the city of London, or arms of a lord mayor, is thus represented. It is worn by the sword-bearer, and is of brown fur.</p>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/091d.png" alt="MAUNDEFELD." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">MAUNDEFELD.</figcaption></figure>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/091e.png" alt="CAPPER." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">CAPPER.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="blazon">The <a href="../c/cap.html">caps</a> borne by MAUNDEFELD are of a peculiar form, similar to that of the 'Doge's' <a href="../c/cap.html">cap</a>. Those borne by DROKENSFORD, and called <a  href="../p/pilia-pastoralia.html">pilia pastoralia</a>(if caps at all), were possibly similar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Quarterly, azure and or four caps counterchanged--DROKENSFORD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The family of CAPPER bear caps, like the figure annexed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three caps sable bended or--CAPPER, Cheshire.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/092a.png" alt="Cardinal's Cap." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Cardinal's Cap.</figcaption></figure>

<a id="092"></a><p class="blazon">A Cardinal's <a href="../c/cap.html">cap</a> or hat is always red, and has tassels pendent from its labels in five rows, instituted by Innocent IV., at the Council of Lyons, 1245. The continental archbishops and bishops(especially those of France) bear green hats of the same form over their mitres, the former with five rows of tassels, and the latter with four. A <a  href="../b/black.html">black</a> <a href="../c/cap.html">caps</a> of the same shape, with three rows of tassels, belongs to abbats. Prothonotaries use a similar hat with two rows of tassels. A <a  href="../b/black.html">black</a> <a  href="../h/hat.html">hat</a> or cap, with one tassel on each side, belongs to all other clergymen.</p>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/092b.png" alt="Cap of Maintenance." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Cap of Maintenance.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="blazon"><a href="../c/cap.html">Cap</a> of Dignity or maintenance, called also <a href="../c/chapeau.html">Chapeau</a>, is a cap generally of <a  href="../r/red.html">red</a> velvet turned up with <a  href="../e/ermine.html">ermine</a>, formerly peculiar to dukes(whence it is sometimes called a <a  href="../d/ducipers.html">duciper</a>), but now often used to place crests upon instead of a <a  href="../w/wreath.html">wreath</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three chapeaus sable(or cap of maintenance)--HALWORTH.</p>
<p class="blazon">The cap of maintenance occurs as a charge in the insignia of the city of GLOUCESTER, and on the seals of Towns of WALLINGFORD and STAINES.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The term <a href="../c/chapeau.html">chapeau</a>, however, is variously used for a <a href="../c/cap.html">cap</a> or hat of any kind. In the <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of COPE it is probably a cap of maintenance; it that of KINGESTON it is probably a hat of some kind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Quarterly ermine and azure, a chapeau gules turned up of the first between two greyhounds courant in pale or--COPE, Osbaston, Leicester.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chapeau azure[elsewhere a steel cap proper], with a plume of ostrich feathers in front gules--John KINGESTON, 1390.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The doctor's <a href="../c/cap.html">cap</a> in the arms of SUGAR refers probably to the University degree.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sable, three sugar-loaves argent, in chief a doctor's cap proper--SUGAR, Somerset.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/092c.png" alt="Long Cap." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Long Cap.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../l/long.html">long</a> <a href="../c/cap.html">Cap</a>, of a peculiar shape, which occurs in the crests of WALPOLE and BRYDGES, is shewn in the margin, and a cap somewhat similar is termed an <a  href="../a/albanian-bonnet.html">Albanian bonnet</a>, probably that worn by the peasantry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, trois bonnets Albanois d'or--VAUX, France.</p>
</blockquote>
<a id="093"></a><p class="blazon">The <a  href="../a/abacot.html">Abacot</a>, a mere corruption of bycocket, is said in Spelman's Glossary to have been given to a <a href="../c/cap.html">cap</a> worn by ancient kings of England, and is so copied into heraldic books.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../i/infula.html">Infula</a> is used in one case in the sense of a cap.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, an infula embowed at the end gules, turned up in form of a hat, and engrailed with a button and tassel at the top or--BRUNT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="blazon"><a href="../c/cap.html">Caps</a> of Steel: of these there are various kinds, and they cannot properly be included under the term <a  href="../h/helmet.html">helmet</a>. The first in the Basinet(fr.), or Basnet, properly a plain circular helmet resembling a basin, though sometimes they are drawn(improperly) like <a  href="../s/squire.html">squires'</a> <a  href="../h/helmet.html">helmets</a>. The Burgonet is a steel cap, worn chiefly by foot-soldiers, and of the shape shewn in the margin.</p>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/093b.png" alt="Morion." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Morion.</figcaption></figure>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/093c.png" alt="Morion." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Morion.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="blazon">There is also the <a  href="../m/morion.html">Morion</a>(fr. <a href="../c/chapeau.html">chapeau</a> de fer), which was worn by foot-soldiers, and is usually of the plain shape annexed, but it may be ornamented. In many ancient examples the points of these morions are turned to the dexter.</p>
<p class="blazon">A somewhat different morion is given on the crest of CECIL, Marquis of Salisbury.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron gules between three basnets proper--BASNET.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a fesse azure between three burgonettes[elsewhere morions] of the second garnished and nailed or--EVINGTON, Enfield, 1614.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron gules between three morions proper--BRUDENEL, Earl of Cardigan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon"><a href="../c/cap.html">Caps</a>(fr. chaperons) are also used for <a  href="../f/falcon.html">Falcons</a>, q.v.</p>
