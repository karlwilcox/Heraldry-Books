<h1>Carnation</h1>
<p>Carnation: (1) improperly used for flesh-colour, as no such tincture is recognised in heraldry(but frequent with French heralds); (2) a flower. The <a  href="../p/pink.html">pink</a> is also found.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three carnations gules, stalked and leaved vert--NOYCE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, on a bend or within a bordure argent two pinks, slipped proper--WADE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Pinks are also borne by families of EDSIR(Surrey), of MARLOW, and of LEVINGSTON, and by SKEVINGTON, Bp. of Bangor, 1510-33.</p>
