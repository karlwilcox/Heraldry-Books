<h1>Champaine</h1>
<p>Champaine, (1) Champaine(corrupted by some writers to Champion), otherwise urd&eacute; and warriated: is an embattled line, but with the <a  href="../t/tops.html">top</a> and bottom of each division pointed instead of <a  href="../s/square.html">square</a>, and so resembling somewhat the line usually drawn in vair. It occurs, though rarely, as a <a  href="../l/lines-of-partition.html">line of partition</a>.</p>
