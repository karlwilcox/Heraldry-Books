<p>Chaplet, (old fr. chapelet, pl. chapeus): is, when not otherwise described, a garland of leaves with four flowers amongst them, at equal distances. It is to be distinguished from the wreath(q.v.), and though usually composed of leaves will be found <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> of various tinctures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sire Rauf LE FITZ WILLIAM, burele de argent e de azure, a iij chapels[in Falkirk roll 'chapeus'] de goules--Roll, temp. ED. II.</p>
<p class="blazon">Party per fesse, argent and azure, three chaplets counterchanged--DUKE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, three chaplets argent--JODRELL, Stafford.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, three chaplets gyronny argent and gules--DYRWARD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">It is more usual, however, to designate the material of which the <a href="../c/chaplet.html">chaplet</a> is composed. It may be of <a  href="../r/rose.html">roses</a>(and this, perhaps, is the most frequent) or of flowers generally, or it may be of <a  href="../l/leaves.html">leaves</a>, and often of laurel leaves. In the latter case it is termed a <a href="../c/crown.html">crown</a> triumphal.</p>
<blockquote>
<a id="101"></a><p class="blazon">Monsire William PLAICE, port d'asur, au chief d'argent deux chapeaux des roses vermals--Roll, temp. ED. III.</p>
<p class="blazon">Monsire de HILTON de Haderness, port d'argent, a trois chepeletts de roses vermaux--Ibid.</p>
<p class="blazon">[Chaplets of roses are also borne by the families of SAXTON; DEAN; FAULDER; GREYSTOCK; FITZRALPH; LASCELLES, and others.]</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, on a chevron sable, between three chaplets of flowers gules, another chevron ermine--BOROUGH.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a lion rampant azure, holding in his dexter paw a chaplet of laurel vert, in chief a scroll sable, thereon the word "Emmanuel" or--EMMANUEL COLL., Cambridge.</p>

<p class="blazon">[Chaplets of laurels are also borne by the families of PELLEW; KEATS, Dover; NIGHTINGALL, Norfolk.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Rarer instances occur of chaplets of holly, or of hazel, or of brambles, while the single instance of the chaplet of rue is a name sometimes given to the <a href="../c/crown.html">crown</a> of rue(q.v.) which occurs in the arms given by Frederick of Barbarossa to the Duke of SAXONY.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a fesse engrailed humetty sable, between three chaplets of holly leaves proper--Nicholas BUBBEWYTH, Bp. of Salisbury, Bath and Wells, 1408-24.</p>

<p class="blazon">When the material is oak the device is often blazoned as a <a  href="../w/wreath.html">wreath</a>, and there is especially a 'wreath of oak acorned' which <a  href="../b/bear.html">bears</a> the name of the 'Civic wreath,' or the Civic Crown. It is supposed to represent the Roman crown conferred upon public benefactors, especially upon those who had saved the life of a citizen. The <a  href="../l/leaves.html">leaves</a> should be represented tied together by a ribbon. The Ducal Coronet(q.v. under <a href="../c/crown.html">Crown</a>) had originally oak leaves, but strawberry-leaves have been substituted.</p>
<blockquote>
<a id="102"></a><p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron gules; in base an oak wreath vert, tied azure; on a chief of the second, three mascles of the first--PELLEW, Cornwall, [1796].</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, on a fesse, between three garbs or, a wreath of oak vert between two estoiles gules--SANDBACH, Lancaster.</p>

<p class="blazon">Argent, a civic crown or wreath of oak acorned proper, on a chief azure a serpent nowed or, and a dove of the field respecting each other--SUTTON, Norfolk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The <a href="../c/crown.html">Crown</a> obsidional is also mentioned in old works on heraldry, which is a chaplet graminy, i.e. composed of twisted grass, and is fancifully said to have been bestowed upon any general who had held a city against a besieging force.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Gules, an eagle displayed argent armed or; on a canton of the second a chaplet graminy vert--GOODALL, Suffolk[granted Mar. 1, 1612].</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The term <a  href="../g/garland.html">garland</a> as well as <a  href="../w/wreath.html">wreath</a>, it will be observed, is used sometimes instead of <a href="../c/chaplet.html">chaplet</a>.</p>
