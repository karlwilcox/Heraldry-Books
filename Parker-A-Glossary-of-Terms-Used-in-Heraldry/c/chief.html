<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/111b.png" alt="LUMLEY." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">LUMLEY.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Chief, (fr. chef): the first of the Ordinaries, and occupying about one-third one the shield from the top downward.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../f/fillet.html">fillet</a> is by some considered its diminutive, while others hold that it can have none. Some English heraldic books, and most foreign, speak of instances of two chiefs, one abased below the other in the same coat, but no English examples are ever adduced.</p>
<p class="blazon">A <a href="../c/chief.html">chief</a> is frequently charged with other bearings, and it may be <a  href="../n/nebuly.html">nebuly</a>, <a  href="../w/wavy.html">wavy</a>, <a  href="../i/indented.html">indented</a>, <a  href="../d/dancette.html">dancetty</a>, <a  href="../e/engrailed.html">engrailed</a>, <a  href="../e/embattled.html">embattled</a>, <a  href="../b/bevilly.html">bevilly</a>, &amp;c., but it is only the lower side which is subjected to these variations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Robert de MORTEYN BRETON, d'ermyn a la cheif de goules. Roll, temp. HEN. III.</p>
<p class="blazon">Rauf le FITZ RANDOLF d'or ung cheif endente d'azur.--Ibid.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sire William DABETOOT, de ermyne od le chef bende de or e de sable. Roll, temp. ED. II.</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, a chief gules--LUMLEY, Essex.</p>
<p class="blazon">Paly of six, argent and sable; a chief wavy azure--BURMAN.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, gouty de poix; a chief nebuly gules--ROYDENHALL.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chief dancetty azure--GLANVILE, Earl of Suffolk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">A <a href="../c/chief.html">chief</a> may also be <a  href="../p/party.html">party</a> per pale, per bend, &amp;c., or even quarterly. When divided by a horizontal line the expression per chief is more accurate than per fesse.</p>

<p class="blazon">The <a href="../c/chief.html">chief</a> does not, as a rule, surmount other charges, and consequently such have often to be abased. The <a  href="../b/bend.html">bend</a>, for instance, starts from the dexter corner just beneath the chief. When associated with a <a  href="../b/bordure.html">bordure</a>(unless there is direct statement to the contrary) the bordure would be turned and continued beneath the base line of the <a href="../c/chief.html">chief</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a chief dancetty argent within a bordure azure--BARET[or BARRATT, Sheriff of London, 1379.]</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, on a bend sable, three roses of the first; on chief gules three crosses patty or--CAREY, Bp. of Exeter, 1820, afterwards Bp. of S.Asaph, 1830-46.</p>

<p class="blazon">It is contended by some writers that the chief has a diminutive, and to a figure as shewn in the margin is given the name of <a  href="../f/fillet.html">fillet</a>. French heralds, however, blazon this as chef retrait, the word filet being used for a <a  href="../d/diminutive.html">diminutive</a> of the cotice. The <a  href="../w/word.html">word</a> <a href="../c/combel.html">combel</a> is also given by some English heraldic writers as meaning the same thing. It is said that the fillet does not occur at all in English arms, but perhaps the following example may be cited--</p>
<blockquote>
<a id="113"></a><p class="blazon">Argent, two bars and a canton gules; over all a fillet sable--BOIS or DEBOYS, 1315, Ingham Church, Norfolk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">In <a href="../c/chief.html">Chief</a> is a term frequently used when the <a href="../c/charge.html">charges</a> are to be placed upon the upper part of the escutcheon, and differently from their ordinary position, There are also three points(q.v.) in the escutcheon connected with the <a href="../c/chief.html">chief</a>, viz. the <a  href="../d/dexter.html">dexter</a> <a href="../c/chief.html">chief</a> <a  href="../p/point.html">point</a>, middle chief point, and sinister chief point.</p>
