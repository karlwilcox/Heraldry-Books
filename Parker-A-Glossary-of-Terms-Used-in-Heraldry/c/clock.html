<h1>Clock</h1>
<p>Clock: this charge is believed to be confined to the bearings of the company which have been thus blazoned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sable, a clock each of the four corner pillars of the case erected on a lion couchant, and on each capital a mound ensigned with a cross patt&eacute;e, and on the dome of the case an imperial crown supposed by circular arches springing from the pillars, under which arches the bell appears, and on the centre of the dial-plate a double rose, all or--CLOCKMAKERS' Company, London.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The credit of this minute example of blazon(presenting a great contrast to the simple insignia of more ancient companies) is due to Sir Edw. Walker, Garter, who granted it in 1677.</p>
