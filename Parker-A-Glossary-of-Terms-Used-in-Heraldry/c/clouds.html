<h1>Clouds</h1>
<p>Clouds(fr. nu&eacute;e) sometimes occur as bearings, as in the cases of the MERCERS' and DRAPERS' Companies, and a few families. Very frequently arms, &amp;c., are represented issuing from the clouds; and in French arms still more so, since the dextrochere as it issues from the side of the shield is generally surrounded by clouds. The partition-line called <a  href="../n/nebuly.html">nebuly</a>(fr. nuag&eacute;), which may be considered as a conventional representation of clouds, is common in heraldry. See also examples under <a  href="../r/ray.html">Ray</a> and Tiara.</p>
