<h1>Cod</h1>
<p>Cod. The representations of different varieties of <a  href="../f/fish.html">fish</a> are not always to be distinguished, though the names are so in the blazon. The <a href="../c/cod.html">Cod</a>, the <a  href="../h/hake.html">Hake</a>, the <a  href="../l/ling.html">Ling</a>, and the <a  href="../w/whiting.html">Whiting</a>(all belonging to the family of Gadid&oelig;Â“), are found on various coats of arms. The <a  href="../h/hake.html">Hake</a> is rather more slender, and comparatively larger about the head, than the cod, but otherwise the drawing does not distinguish the several kinds. Indeed the drawing of fish in heraldry is very arbitrary, and it will be observed it is mostly in punning arms that fish occur.</p>
