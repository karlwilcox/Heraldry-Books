<h1>Cormorant</h1>
<p>Cormorant(lat. Phalacrocorax, fr. Cormoran), written by some naturalists, Corvorant, occurs at times in arms. The <a  href="../b/birds.html">bird</a> in the arms of WARBURTON, and forming a portion of the insignia of LIVERPOOL, is a cormorant, but it is known and blazoned there by name of the <a  href="../l/lever.html">lever</a>. Perhaps the Sea Aylet also may be considered similar to the Cormorant. Cormorants' <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a> sometimes are borne, as also <a  href="../s/sea-aylet.html">Sea Aylet</a> <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a>.</p>
