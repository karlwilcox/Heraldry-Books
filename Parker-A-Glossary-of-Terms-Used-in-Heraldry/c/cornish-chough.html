<p>Cornish Chough: a bird of the crow kind, very common in Cornwall. It is bluish black, with <a  href="../r/red.html">red</a> or orange-coloured beak and legs. This bearing was confined to Cornish families until Barker, who was Garter King of Arms, temp. HEN. VIII. granted it indiscriminately to any applicants for arms, and amongst others to Cardinal WOLSEY, who was borne in Suffolk; and so now borne by CHRIST CHURCH College, Oxford. [See an illustration of these arms under <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazon</a>.]</p>
