<h1>Couped</h1>
<p>Couped, or Coupy, (fr. alais&eacute;), cut off in a straight line, as in often the case with the <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a> and limbs of animals, and so distinguished form erased[see example under <a  href="../b/boar.html">Boar</a>]. It is important to say where a head or limbs is couped; for instance, if couped close it would signify cut off close to the head. A <a  href="../h/hand.html">hand</a> is often said to be couped at the wrist.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../w/word.html">word</a> <a href="../c/couped.html">couped</a> is sometimes applied to the extremities of ordinaries, but they are more often said to be humett&eacute; or ales&eacute;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Per fesse sable and or, a tree couped and eradicated counterchanged--BUCHER,</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a dexter hand couped at the wrist argent--BROME, co. Salop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Couped-fitchy is an expression used to signify that the cutting is not by a clean straight stroke, but that a point is left projecting.</p>
<p class="blazon">Heraldic writers say that an ordinary when <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> <a href="../c/couped.html">couped</a> and voided would differ essentially from the same <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">ordinary</a> <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> <a  href="../v/voided.html">voided</a> and couped; but as no examples are given shewing that the difference exists in fact, it is hardly necessary to lay it drawn as a rule.</p>
<p class="blazon">The French coup&eacute; has a distinct meaning, and is frequently employed to signify the <a  href="../p/partition.html">partition</a> of the <a  href="../s/shield.html">shield</a> horizontally into two equal parts. English heralds would describe the same as <a  href="../p/party.html">party</a> per fesse.</p>
