<h1>Couple-close</h1>
<p>Couple-close: this is one of the diminutives of the chevron, of which it should be one-fourth the width. Couple-closes are always borne in pairs, from which circumstance they derive their name. They are often borne with the <a href="../c/chevron.html">chevron</a>, which is then said to be between couple-closes, a more exact expression perhaps than coticed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, on a chevron between two couple-closes indented sable three escallops or--GONVILL. [The arms of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, founded 1348.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Couple-close. See <a href="../c/chevronel.html">Chevronel</a>.</p>
