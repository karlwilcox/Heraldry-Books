<h1>Crane</h1>
<p>Crane: this bird(grus cineria, fr. grue) is in heraldry often confounded with the <a  href="../h/heron.html">heron</a> and stork, it being in ordinary drawing precisely similar. It is borne by the following, and in two cases it will be observed that the crane holds in the dexter foot a stone, a somewhat singular device.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a crane sable standing on a staff raguly in base vert--CRANE, Cornwall.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a crane thrust through with a sword argent--FITHIE, Scotland.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a saltire ermine, between two cranes in pale argent and two garbs in fesse or--KIRSOPP, Northumberland.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a crane without the head argent--FINNIE, Scotland.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a crane holding a stone in the dexter foot gules; on a chief vert three crescents of the first--SIMPSON, Scotland.</p>
<p class="blazon">Per chevron or and gules, in chief two cinquefoils of the second stalked and leaved vert, and in base a crane, argent, in the dexter foot a stone sable--DEARMAN.</p>
