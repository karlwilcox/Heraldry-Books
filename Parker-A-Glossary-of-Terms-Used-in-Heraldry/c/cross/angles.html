<h1>Angles of the Cross</h1>
<p><b><a id="Cross10">&sect;10</a>. In some few cases, but rarely in English heraldry, from the angles formed by the meeting of the arms there project certain charges</b>, e.g. <a  href="../../r/ray.html">rays</a>, <a  href="../../a/acorn.html">acorns</a>, <a  href="../../f/fleur-de-lis.html">fleur-de-lis</a>, &amp;c.; with <a  href="../../r/ray.html">rays</a> the term <a  href="../../r/rayonnant.html">rayonnante</a> would be used. The French term is angl&eacute; of such a charge, but there is no English equivalent. Edmondson uses the expression "adorned at angles," but gives no example.</p>

<p>We now come to crosses which have special names, derived either from their general outline or from their termination.</p>
