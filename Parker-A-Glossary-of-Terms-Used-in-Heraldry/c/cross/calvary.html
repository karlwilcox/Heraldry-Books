<p><b><a id="Cross15">&sect;15</a>. <a id="Cross-Calvary">Cross Calvary</a></b>, (fr. cr. de Calvaire): is a long cross or Latin cross(that is with the lower limb longer than the other three, and raised upon three steps). It has been poetically said that the three steps are symbolical of the three Christian graces, Faith, Hope, and Charity, and it is suggested by theoretical writers that the bearer took the arms in consequence of having <a  href="../../e/erect.html">erected</a> such a cross at Rome. It is also sometimes called a Holy cross.</p>

<p>The <a  href="../../p/passion.html">Passion</a> <a href="../../c/cross.html">Cross</a>, or <a  href="../../l/long.html">Long</a> <a href="../../c/cross.html">Cross</a>(fr. haute croix), resembles the true Latin cross in form, but seldom occurs except when it is raised on three steps, and it is then called a <a href="../../c/cross/Calvary.html">Cross Calvary</a>. See also <a href="../../c/crucifix.html">Crucifix</a>.</p>

<p>But the steps or degrees, or grieces(spelt also <a  href="../../g/grice.html">grices</a>), as they are variously termed, are sometimes referred to apart from the Cross of Calvary, and the term graded or degraded is employed. Consequently a cross degraded(fr. &agrave; degr&eacute;s, and sometimes enserr&eacute;e de degr&eacute;s and peronn&eacute;e) and conjoined signifies a plain cross, having its extremities placed upon steps joined to the sides of the shield. The number of the steps should be mentioned, as it is often four, and sometimes as many as eight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a cross graded of three sable--WYNTWORTH.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a cross degraded and conjoined(or issuing from eight degrees), sable--WOODHOUSE.</p>
