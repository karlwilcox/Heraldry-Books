<p><b><a id="Cross7">&sect;7</a>. At with other ordinaries</b>, a cross may be <a href="../../c/couped.html">couped</a>; and then it is termed <a  href="../../h/humetty.html">humetty</a>(fr. alais&eacute;e, spelt sometimes al&eacute;s&eacute;e), though the term coup&eacute;e seems to be occasionally used. Of course all the four arms are couped, unless there is any distinguishing note to the contrary. It would also appear that this cross should be always drawn with its arms equal. When more than one cross or crosslet occurs in the same <a  href="../../s/shield.html">shield</a> it stands to reason they must be humetty, so that it is not necessary to mention it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">D'argent, &agrave; la croix alais&eacute;e de gueules--XAINTRAILLES, Ile de France.</p>
<p class="blazon">A cross humetty between four plain crosslets--John de PONTISSARA, Bp. of Winchester, 1282-1304.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a bend wavy in the sinister chief a cross coupy argent--arms assigned to William de CURBELLIO, Abp. of Canterbury, 1123-36.</p>
</blockquote>
<a id="155"></a><p>The term <a  href="../../h/humetty.html">humetty</a> is sometimes used in connection with special terminations to the arms of the cross, but practically it is needless, for were the cross extended to the edges there would be no room for such terminations. See e.g. <a href="../../c/cross/annuletty.html">cross annuletty</a>,  &sect;11, and fleuretty,  &sect;20; also <a  href="../../g/gringole.html">gringol&eacute;e</a> and the like,  &sect;21. To these might be added anserated and ancetty(from the French anse, 'a handle'), though the terms have not been observed in any English blazon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a cross humetty terminated with four leopard's heads or--PECKHAM.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a cross humetty gules, the point in chief terminating in a crescent of the last--WANLEY.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, billetty argent, a cross humetty at top, and there flory of the last--Sir John MORIS, co. Gloucester[Harl. MS. 1465, fol. 53].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand a cross patt&eacute;e(which is naturally humetty) must be blazoned as <a  href="../../t/throughout.html">throughout</a> or fixed, if it is intended that the four arms of the cross should reach to the edges of the shield. See  &sect;26.</p>
<p>See also <a  href="../../p/passant.html">passant</a>, as meaning of <a  href="../../t/throughout.html">throughout</a>.</p>
<p>The French term <a  href="../../t/tronconne.html">tron&ccedil;onn&eacute;</a>, signifying that the cross is broken up into small cubes, is given by Edmondson, and others, but no examples have been noticed either in French or English arms.</p>
<p>One example only of a demi-cross has been observed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron between three demi-crosses gules--TOKETT.</p>
