<h1>Cross Crosslet</h1>
<p><b><a id="Cross17">&sect;17</a>. <a id="Crosslet">Crosslet</a></b>, (fr. croissette or petit croix): two or more crosses are sometimes borne in the same coat, and are then termed <a href="../../c/cross/crosslet.html">crosslets</a>. If only two or three are borne they may be termed <a href="../../c/cross.html">crosses</a> or crosslets. If more, they must be termed <a href="../../c/cross/crosslet.html">crosslets</a>. They are drawn couped, but it is not necessary to mention that circumstance, because they could not be otherwise.</p>

<p>Distinct, however, from the crosslet is the cross crosslet, or, as it is sometimes, though rarely, termed a <a href="../../c/cross.html">cross</a> <a href="../../c/crossed.html">crossed</a>(fr. <a href="../../c/croix.html">croix</a> crois&eacute;e). By rights, however, a cross crossed is equivalent to a cross crosslet fixed, that is, the arms extend to the extremities of the escutcheon.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../c/cross.html">Cross</a> <a href="../../c/cross/crosslet.html">crosslet</a> is often borne <a  href="../../f/fitche.html">fitched</a>; it may also have each extremity formed like those of the cross patt&eacute;e, and it is then called a <a href="../../c/cross.html">Cross</a> <a href="../../c/cross/crosslet.html">crosslet</a> <a  href="../../p/pattee.html">patt&eacute;e</a>.</p>
<p>But further, a Cross crosslet may be itself crossed(fr. recroisset&eacute;e), though there have been differences of opinion as to its character. The true signification of this term seems to be a cross composed of four cross crosslets, but Gerard Leigh represents it as shewn in the margin.</p>
