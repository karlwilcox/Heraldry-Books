<h1>Cross Hame&ccedil;on</h1>
<a id="166"></a><p><b><a id="Cross22">&sect;22</a>. <a id="Cross-hamecon">A Cross hame&ccedil;on</a></b> is given in heraldic books, but appears to be borne only by one family in England, and that probably of foreign origin. The name implies that the ends should be represented like <a  href="../../f/fish-hook.html">fish-hooks</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a cross hame&ccedil;on argent--MAGENS, Sussex.</p>
