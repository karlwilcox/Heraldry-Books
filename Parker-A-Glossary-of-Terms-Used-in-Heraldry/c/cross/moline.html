<p><b><a id="Cross24">&sect;24</a>. <a id="Cross-moline">We next come to a cross having a great variety of nomenclature as well as of form. The ordinary and correct term is the Cross moline</a></b>, and like the <a  href="../../f/fer-de-moline.html">fer-de-moline</a> or mill-rind, from which it derives its name, the ends are bifurcated. But they are usually made to turn over like the two side lobes of the cross fleury, the central lobe being absent.</p>
<p>Neither the fer-de-moline nor the cross moline occurs in the rolls of Henry III. In those of Edward II. the fer-de-moline occurs as a <a href="../../c/charge.html">charge</a>, and also the <a href="../../c/cross/recercelee.html">cross recercel&eacute;e</a>(q.v.), which may perhaps represent the Cross moline; but by some heralds the term <a href="../../c/cross/recercelee.html">Cross recercel&eacute;e</a>, q.v., is supposed to be confined to a cr. moline <a  href="../../v/voided.html">voided</a>.</p>
<a id="167"></a><p>Moreover, with the author of the poem which describes the siege of Caerlaverock, the term <a  href="../../f/fer-de-moline.html">Fer-de-moline</a> appears to mean the <a href="../../c/cross/moline.html">Cross moline</a>, as there is no doubt the arms of Antony BECK, the warrior-bishop of Durham, 'who sent has banner of red, with a <a  href="../../f/fer-de-moline.html">fer-de-moline</a> of <a  href="../../e/ermine.html">ermine</a>,' were somewhat as represented in the margin, since a Bishop would be sure to bear a cross.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../c/cross/recercelee.html">Cross recercel&eacute;e</a> too is found more frequently in the later rolls, e.g. in Edward III.'s reign, and then it will be seen that the cross moline occurs but in one instance.</p>

<p>The drawings very in the extent to which the bifurcated end is curved, and either of those shewn in the margin may be followed. It they are much more curved, the term 'anchory' may perhaps be given to the <a href="../../c/cross.html">cross</a>, a translation of the French term ancr&eacute;e, which seems to represent the cross moline; but it is not a very happy description, as the ends are not drawn like the <a  href="../../f/fluke.html">flukes</a> of an <a  href="../../a/anchor.html">anchor</a>.</p>

<a id="168"></a><p>The <a href="../../c/cross.html">cross</a> called by French writers anill&eacute;e, and varied in spelling by French and English writers into nesl&eacute;e, nysl&eacute;e, nill&eacute;e, &amp;c., seems to be but another name for the <a href="../../c/cross/moline.html">cross moline</a>, the French anille being exactly the same as the mill-rind. But because some French heralds have drawn the curved extremities more slender than is usual in English drawing, the cross anill&eacute;e has been described as a very thin cross anchory.</p>

<p>A severer form, and perhaps one more skin to the original notion of the fer-de-moline, is one with rectangular ends, which <a  href="../../h/herald.html">heralds</a> have named cross mill-rind, abbreviated into cross miller). But so far as has been observed the title occurs only in heraldic works, and is not applied especially to any actual arms.</p>
<p>Under this head it may be <a  href="../../w/well.html">well</a> to include the Cross fourch&eacute;e. It is found in ancient blazon, particularly in the roll of arms of the time of Henry III., and in one the term <a  href="../../f/fourche.html">fourch&eacute;</a> au kanee occurs, which has been itself a crux to heraldic writers. The exact form of the <a href="../../c/cross.html">cross</a> <a  href="../../f/fourche.html">fourch&eacute;</a> is not known, but it is supposed to be like that in the margin, for which later heralds have invented the term <a href="../../c/cross.html">cross</a> miller rebated. In French heraldic works a distinction seems to be made between fourch&eacute;e and fourchet&eacute;e, but it is not clear what that distinction is.</p>

<a id="169"></a><p>In connection with the <a href="../../c/cross.html">cross</a> <a  href="../../f/fourche.html">fourch&eacute;</a> may be noted the erroneous blazon of the shake fork(q.v.) as a <a href="../../c/cross.html">cross</a> <a  href="../../p/pall.html">pall</a>; it is not, however, a cross at all; it is the forked character of the pall which has led to a combination of the two ideas.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../c/cross/moline.html">Cross moline</a> is said to be sometimes used as a mark of cadency.</p>
