<h1>Cross Nowy</h1>
<p><b><a id="Cross25">&sect;25</a>. <a id="Cross-nowy">Cross nowy</a></b>. When the term is used by itself it is supposed to signify that the arms of the cross, instead of meeting and forming right-angles, stop at the edge of a circle, which, so to speak, cuts off the angles; at least, it is represented thus in the drawing given in Edmondson. Thence varieties are imagined, viz. <a  href="../../n/nowy.html">nowy</a> <a  href="../../l/lozengy.html">lozengy</a>, <a  href="../../n/nowy.html">nowy</a> <a  href="../../m/masculy.html">masculy</a>, &amp;c., with each of the angles filled by a projection of half a lozenge, mascle, &amp;c., but no examples are named. Nowy quadrate, however, is applied when the projections appear to form a square, and an example will be found <a  href="../../f/figured.html">figured</a> in the Arms of LICHFIELD under <a href="../../c/cross.html">cross</a>  &sect;31.</p>
<p>There is a term also said to be used, namely, nowyed, which means that the projection need not be in the centre but in each of the arms of the cross. Both <a  href="../../n/nowy.html">nowy</a> and nowyed, however, are quite distinct from nowed(fr. nou&eacute;), applied to <a  href="../../s/serpent.html">serpents</a>, &amp;c.</p>
