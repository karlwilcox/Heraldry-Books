<p><b><a id="Cross26">&sect;26</a>. <a id="Cross-pattee">The term Cross patt&eacute;e</a></b>(fr.), more often writen patty, primarily means that the arms of the cross become expanded, of opened out, as they approach the edge of the shield. Named by itself, it means that the extremities are bounded by a straight line, that is, they are couped before reaching the edge of the shield. If otherwise, that is if the arms are extended to the edge of the field, the word throughout must be added(or, as some prefer, fixed, ferme, or entire); or if they have any other termination, e.g. <a  href="../../f/flory.html">flory</a>, <a  href="../../p/pometty.html">pometty</a>, &amp;c., such termination must be named; but in this case they belong rather to the class of Cross patonce(q.v.). In one case the ends are indented by a hollow(see below, under DYMOCK), and Berry gives a figure of a cross patty notched, but gives no name of bearer.</p>
<a id="170"></a><p>As to the expanding sides of the cross there seems to be no rule, but they are generally drawn slightly curved outwards, and not straight, as in the Maltese cross. Amidst the various forms which appear in the works of different authors it is difficult to define the line of demarcation between it and its kindred, cross patonce, which is described in the next article.</p>
<p>The extremities in French arms are sometimes so much curved that the outline of the four arms represent so many segments of a circle. With the French, however, the rule is for the Cross patt&eacute;e to reach to the edge, and when it does not the term alais&eacute;e is introduced. It is not at all unusual in English arms for the lower extremity of the cross patty to be terminated in a point, and then it is blazoned <a href="../../c/cross/pattee.html">cross patty</a> <a  href="../../f/fitche.html">fitchy</a>. Cross crosslets may also be <a  href="../../p/pattee.html">patty</a>, and the <a  href="../../d/device.html">device</a> is then a very striking one. A <a href="../../c/cross/pattee.html">Cross patty</a> is also said to be used as a mark of cadency.</p>

<p>As to the synonym form&eacute;e or formy, which appears to be used with modern heralds as frequently as <a  href="../../p/pattee.html">patty</a>, it is difficult to explain its origin or meaning. One example is found in a roll as early Henry III., but no other till a roll of Edw. III., where certain small crosses are described as <a  href="../../f/forme.html">form&eacute;</a> de lis, that is, made up of the four flowers united in the centre. This may therefore be the origin of the term, since it will be observed that the same <a  href="../../a/arms.html">arms</a> are blazoned in the previous reign(see above) as bearing 'iij crois pat&eacute;es.' It will be noted also that, as read by NICOLAS, the word lis appears as lij, but there can scarcely be much room to doubt the true reading.</p>
