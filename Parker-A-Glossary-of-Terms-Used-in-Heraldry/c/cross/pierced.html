<h1>Cross Pierced</h1>
<p><b><a id="Cross9">&sect;9</a>. The expression pierced is applied to crosses</b>, and is variously used. The term <a  href="../../p/pierced.html">pierced</a>(more frequently applied to <a  href="../../m/mullet.html">mullets</a> than similar charges) implies that there is a circular opening, and the field shewn through, and such opening would be in the centre of the cross. But the opening may be of a <a  href="../../l/lozenge.html">lozenge</a> form or of a square form. When the whole of the centre is of the tincture of the field it is, as has already been described, to be blazoned <a  href="../../q/quarterly.html">quarterly</a> <a  href="../../p/pierced.html">pierced</a>; but, farther, some heralds contend that if the aperture does not occupy the whole of the central portion where the arms meet, it is to be blazoned <a  href="../../q/quarter-pierced.html">quarter-pierced</a>.</p>
