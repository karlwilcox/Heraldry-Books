<a id="174"></a><p><b><a id="Cross29">&sect;29</a>. <a id="Cross-pomel">Cross pomel, or pommelly</a></b>(fr. bourdonn&eacute;e). A <a  href="../../p/plain.html">plain</a> <a href="../../c/cross.html">cross</a> terminating in four round pomels, e.g. like the knob at the end of swordhilts, or in bourdons, that is, the knobs at the top of the pilgrims' staves. But there is much confusion arising from carelessness is writing the name in different ways. We find pomy, and very frequently pometty(fr. pommett&eacute;e), and some heralds contend that the latter means something different, i.e. that there are two knobs terminating the arms of the cross; others say that it means a <a href="../../c/cross.html">cross</a> with a circular protuberance in the middle of each arm(like the escarbuncle). Again, in some French blazoning, the term <a  href="../../p/pometty.html">pomett&eacute;e</a> signifies having knobs at several angles, as in the case of the Cross of Toulouse, given under <a href="../../c/cleche.html">cleche</a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The French term Moussue, mouss&eacute;, or &eacute;mouss&eacute;, appears to mean a <a href="../../c/cross.html">cross</a> with the ends simply rounded at the extremities, from an obsolete word equivalent to blunted, and is given in some heraldic works, but without examples.</p>
