<h1>Cubes</h1>
<p>Cubes, or Blocks: a somewhat indefinite term for <a  href="../s/square.html">squares</a> appearing on a shield. So uncertain is the intention of the draughtsman, that sometimes the very same <a href="../c/charge.html">charges</a> are blazoned as <a  href="../d/dice.html">dice</a>, <a  href="../d/delf.html">delves</a>, which are elsewhere blazoned as <a  href="../b/block.html">blocks</a>, or <a  href="../g/gad.html">gads</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Or, on a chevron gules between three cubes pean as many horse-shoes argent--WILLIAMS, co. Pembroke.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, on a chevron engrailed three blocks or, each charged with a cross of the second--HOBSON, Harl. MS. A.D. 1404.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, on three blocks(or billets, or delves, or dice), argent, an annulet to each sable--PAYNTER, Cornwall.</p>
