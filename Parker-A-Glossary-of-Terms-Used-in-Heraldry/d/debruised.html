<h1>Debruised</h1>
<p>Debruised, (fr. bris&eacute;): 1. a term applied more especially to an animal having an <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">ordinary</a> or other charge over it, which also extends over part of the field as well. It is more usual to blazon an ordinary thus treated as <a  href="../s/surmounted-by.html">surmounted by</a>, though there does not appear to be any very definite rule followed as to the distinctive used of the two terms. It will be observed that this differs essentially from one bearing being charged with another, because in the latter case the sur-charge does not extend into the field.</p>

<a id="196"></a><p class="blazon">The terms depressed and oppressed seem to have practically the same signification as above.</p>

<p class="blazon">Or, five annulets, one within the other vert, embracing and depressed by a cross engrailed gules--Robert GYFFARD.</p>
