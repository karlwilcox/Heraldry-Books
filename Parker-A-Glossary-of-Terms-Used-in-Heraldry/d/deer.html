<p>Deer: the term <a href="../d/deer.html">deer</a>(fr. <a href="../d/daim.html">daim</a>, old fr. deym) is seldom used is blazoning, but it is convenient to employ it here as a general name under which to group several of the family of Cervid&oelig;Â“. First and most common is the stag itself(fr. cerf), but other names appear, frequently representing varieties of <a  href="../s/stag.html">stags</a>, and in some cases evidently used for the sake of the name, rather than for any difference which could be shewn in the drawing. They are Hart, Buck, Roe, Roebuck, Doe, Fawn, Hind(fr. biche), Brocket. The <a  href="../b/brocket.html">Brocket</a> is a young stag up to two years, or(according to some authors) to three years, old; it becomes a Buck in its sixth year. With them may be classed the Reindeer(fr. renchier), which <a  href="../h/herald.html">heralds</a> distinguish from the stag by double attires, one pair erect, the other pendent, as shewn in the diagram in the margin.</p>
<a id="197"></a><p class="blazon">It may be added that the old name was simply cerf, and according to the rolls it is chiefly the head which appears on the ancient arms, but it will be observed that the two examples given are probably both allusive. In the first the biche(fr. for hind) probably refers to the name BECHE; and in the second the 'hert' or 'hart' distinctly alludes to the name HERTFORD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sire Johan de BECHE, de argent, a une bende de goules a iij testes de cerfs de or en la cantel un merelos de sable--Roll, temp. ED. II.</p>
<p class="blazon">Monsire de HERTFORD port d'argent a une fes sable a trois testes de cerfs d'or en la fes--Roll, temp. ED. III.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Taking the stag the typical beast of chase, it will be well here to note the terms which are especially applied in heraldry to the positions in which it may be represented.</p>
<p class="blazon">It may be <a  href="../s/statant.html">statant</a>(fr. arr&ecirc;t&eacute;), which means that it is standing still, with all its feet touching the ground; while statant at gaze, or standing at gaze, means that it is the same, and guardant(which is the term used of <a  href="../b/beasts.html">beasts</a> of prey). Further, it may be represented as grazing, or more correctly(of stags) browsing, that is, with its head touching the ground, in the act of feeding; or at bay, i.e. with <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a> downwards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a stag statant gules--HOLME.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a stag statant at gaze gules--GRYFFYDD GWR.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a stag standing at gaze argent, attired or--JONES.</p>
<p class="blazon">Ermine, three stags at gaze gules--BLYTHE, Bp. of Salisbury, 1493-99.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, on a mount vert a hind grazing argent--HENDLEY, Lancaster.</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, two tilting spears in saltire sable, surmounted by a stag browsing proper; a chief azure .... --THORNHILL, Derby.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Or, again, a stag may be <a  href="../t/trippant.html">trippant</a>, or tripping, that is passant, but in a leisurely manner(and when two, counter-trippant); while courant, or more properly, in full course(fr. elanc&eacute;), means that the stag must be represented as if passing at full speed. Again, instead of the term <a  href="../r/rampant.html">rampant</a>, which is applied to <a  href="../b/beasts.html">beasts</a> of prey, the terms used for <a  href="../s/stag.html">stags</a> are springing, or salient.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Or, lastly, the stag may be <a  href="../c/couchant.html">couchant</a>, or more properly lodged, which latter is a term used specially of the stag. It may also be represented in a sitting posture, when the term <a  href="../s/sejant.html">sejant</a> is applied, the same as that used for other animals.</p>

<p class="blazon">Argent, a stag sejant gules attired or, in the mouth a trefoil slipped proper--BOWEN.</p>
</blockquote>
<a id="199"></a><p class="blazon">Besides these the expressions applied to other animals are found sometimes used, e.g. <a  href="../u/unguled.html">unguled</a> when the hoofs are of different tincture, armed(though this very improperly), to include both <a  href="../h/horn.html">horns</a> and hoods, and also <a  href="../l/langued.html">langued</a>; and so also the terms <a  href="../p/passant.html">passant</a>, <a  href="../g/guardant.html">guardant</a>, and <a  href="../r/regardant.html">reguardant</a>, and even rampant, are found.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Quarterly or and azure, four roebucks passant counterchanged--ROSINDALE, [4441].</p>
<p class="blazon">Vert, a buck rampant proper--PARKER, Cheshire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">As already noted under <a  href="../a/attire.html">attires</a> the <a  href="../h/horn.html">horns</a> of the <a  href="../s/stag.html">stag</a> are considered as ornaments, and hence the term <a  href="../a/attire.html">attired</a> is more properly employed than either armed or horned. An old term for the <a  href="../s/stag.html">stag's</a> <a  href="../h/horn.html">horns</a> is perches. The number of tynes or projections from the beam is sometimes given, if not it is quite optional. Also it may be observed that stags' <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a> are very frequently adopted. In one case even the stag's <a  href="../e/ear.html">ears</a>. When the front only of the head, with the <a  href="../a/attire.html">attires</a>, but without the neck, is shewn, it may be called a <a  href="../s/stag.html">stag's</a> <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a> <a  href="../c/caboshed.html">caboshed</a>(fr. <a  href="../r/rencontre.html">rencontre</a>); the French term <a  href="../m/massacre.html">massacre</a> may also be used, though some think that only a portion of the cranium should in this case be shewn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Or, a stag's head couped and attired with six tynes on every horn sable--CALDER, Scotland.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three stag's heads couped argent, attired with ten tynes or--PORTEOUS, Scotland.</p>

<p class="blazon">One of the badges of Richard II. was a white hart couchant beneath a tree proper, gorged with a <a  href="../c/crown.html">crown</a> and chained or.
