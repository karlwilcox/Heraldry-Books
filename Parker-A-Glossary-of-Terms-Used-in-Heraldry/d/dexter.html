<h1>Dexter</h1>
<p>Dexter: the right-hand side of the shield, being that to the left of the spectator. A <a  href="../b/bend.html">bend</a>, if not otherwise blazoned, is supposed to be a bend dexter, but a baston is often described as a <a href="../d/dexter.html">dexter</a> baston. The term is frequently applied to the <a  href="../h/hand.html">hand</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a lion rampant gules, over all a dexter baston compony or and azure--Piers LUCIEN.</p>
