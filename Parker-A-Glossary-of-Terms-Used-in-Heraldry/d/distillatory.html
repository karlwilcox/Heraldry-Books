<p>Distillatory: this device, borne by the DISTILLERS' Company, and usually blazoned 'a distillatory double armed,' is represented on their arms as is the margin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a fesse wavy argent, in chief the sun in splendour encircled with a cloud distilling drops of rain all proper; in base a distillatory double armed or on a fire proper, with two worms and bolt receivers of the second--DISTILLERS' Company[Incorporated 1638].</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Another 'distillatory,' or 'still,' is represented as the smaller engraving, and appears as the <a  href="../c/crest.html">crest</a> of the family of WYNINGTON, London.</p>
