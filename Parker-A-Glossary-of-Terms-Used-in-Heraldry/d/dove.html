<h1>Dove</h1>
<p>Dove, (fr. colombe): the Dove is very frequent device; sometimes the turtle dove and sometimes the <a  href="../r/ringed.html">ringed</a> <a href="../d/dove.html">dove</a> are specially mentioned. And also with the <a href="../d/dove.html">dove</a> may be grouped the <a  href="../p/pigeon.html">Pigeon</a>, with its fellows the Stock-dove and Wood-pigeon. It is said to have been adopted as an emblem of purity, and sometimes it appears as the Holy Dove. The <a href="../d/dove.html">Dove</a> is subjected to the usual terms expressing position, &amp;c., applicable to birds(see <a  href="../e/eagle.html">eagle</a>), but the more frequent are volant, close, rising, and often having an olive-branch or some sprig in the mouth, and in one case 'displayed in a glory,' and also nimbed. It may be, of course, also <a  href="../m/membered.html">membered</a>, <a  href="../l/legged.html">legged</a>, <a  href="../b/beaked.html">beaked</a>, <a  href="../b/bill.html">billed</a>, &amp;c., of a different tincture.</p>
<p class="blazon">It will be observed that the dove very frequently occurs in the arms granted to Bishops, and sometimes it is used evidently for the sake of the name.</p>
