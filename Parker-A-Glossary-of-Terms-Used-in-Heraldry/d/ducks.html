<h1>Ducks</h1>
<p>Ducks, (fr. canard): We find this very large family(anatin&oelig;Â“) represented in heraldry under several names. The <a href="../d/ducks.html">duck</a> <a  href="../p/proper.html">proper</a>, as also the <a href="../d/drake.html">drake</a>. The shield-drake, or sheldrake, as it is written(anas tadorna). The <a  href="../w/wild-duck.html">wild-duck</a>(anas boschas), with the <a  href="../t/teal.html">teal</a>(anas crecea) and the mallard. What is meant by the sea-teal is not certain. The sholarde, or shoveller(anas clypeata) may be distinguished by two small tufts of feathers, one on the back of the head, another on ther breast.</p>
