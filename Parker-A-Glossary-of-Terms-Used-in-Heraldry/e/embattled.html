<h1>Embattled</h1>
<p>Embattled, battled, battelly, crenelled, or kernelled: a line of <a  href="../p/partition.html">partition</a> resembling a row of battlements, (from which it derived its origin and its name) across the shield; the term may also be applied to the edge of an ordinary.</p>
<p class="blazon">When a <a  href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a> or bend or chevron is said to be embattled, it implies that it is so upon the upper side only, though sometimes this is mentioned(fr. crenell&eacute;), and the term super-embattled is occasionally found. When a fess or a chief is embattled on the under <a  href="../s/side.html">side</a> only, the French use the term bastill&eacute;.</p>

<a id="223"></a><p class="blazon">The "crenelles" are properly speaking the embrasures or open spaces between the "merlons," which are the upright solid pieces.</p>
<p class="blazon">If the ordinary is crenellated on both <a  href="../s/side.html">sides</a> it may be said to be embattled counter embattled, and this is properly used only when the crenelles on one side are opposite to the merlons on the other, and vice vers&acirc;. It may also be said to be bretess&eacute;, and this is properly used with English heralds, to signify that the crenelles are opposite to each other. With French heralds, however, the word bretess&eacute; is frequently used for <a  href="../c/counter-embattled.html">counter embattled</a>, and these terms do not seem to be used with their respective meaning very strictly even by English heralds.</p>

<p class="blazon"><a  href="../b/battled.html">Battled</a> <a href="../e/embattled.html">embattled</a>, or <a  href="../b/battled.html">battled</a> <a  href="../g/grady.html">grady</a>, is a name given to a figure having, as it were, an extra battlement, but, as usual for these fanciful names, no examples are given. And the same may be said of <a  href="../b/battled.html">battled</a> <a  href="../a/arrondi.html">arrondi</a>, i.e. with the <a  href="../t/tops.html">tops</a> of the battlements rounded instead of straight. The term double embattled, however, does occur, and it is possibly the same as <a  href="../g/grady.html">grady</a>.</p>
