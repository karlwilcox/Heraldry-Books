<h1>Ensign</h1>
<p>Ensign, or Insignia, (fr. enseigne): the more correct term for the armorial bearings of a Kingdom, of an Office, or of a Community. In common parlance, however, the Arms of England, or the arms of this or that town, are spoken of.</p>
<p class="blazon">The term <a href="../e/ensign.html">ensigned</a> has a different signification, and is used of a <a  href="../c/charge.html">charge</a> having a <a  href="../c/cross.html">cross</a>, or <a  href="../m/mitre.html">mitre</a>, or <a  href="../c/crown.html">crown</a>, placed above it, and the term <a  href="../s/supporting.html">supporting</a> such a charge is sometimes used also with the same signification. It is to be distinguished from enfiled. A <a  href="../s/staff.html">staff</a> also may be <a href="../e/ensign.html">ensigned</a> with a <a  href="../f/flag.html">flag</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sable, a chevron ensigned with a cross patty argent--FAIRFIELD.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, an annulet ensigned with a cross patty, and interlaced with a saltire, couped and conjoined at base or--Borough of Southwark.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, an oak tree eradicated in bend sinister vert, surmounted by a sword in bend dexter azure, hilted or, ensigned on the front with a royal crown of the last--M'GREGOR.</p>
