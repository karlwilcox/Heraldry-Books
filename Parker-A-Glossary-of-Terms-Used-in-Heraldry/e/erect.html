<h1>Erect</h1>
<p>Erect: the term used by <a  href="../h/herald.html">heralds</a> for <a  href="../u/upright.html">upright</a>, as of <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a> of animals, fishes, &amp;c.; also of <a  href="../l/lion.html">lions'</a> <a  href="../t/tail.html">tails</a>, placed perpendicularly; and of the hand in the baronet's <a  href="../b/badge.html">badge</a>. The <a  href="../w/word.html">word</a> should not be used with relation to any charge, the natural position of which is upright, as a <a  href="../f/flowers.html">flower</a> or a tree; it is very properly used for <a  href="../l/leaves.html">leaves</a> and fruit, of which the natural position is pendent. The <a  href="../w/word.html">word</a> is also supposed to be more properly used of certain animals and reptiles instead of <a  href="../r/rampant.html">rampant</a>, and of <a  href="../c/crab.html">crabs</a> and lobsters instead of <a  href="../h/haurient.html">haurient</a>; it is sometimes applied even to fish, though perhaps improperly. Insects also are found <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as <a href="../e/erect.html">erect</a>, e.g. <a  href="../b/bee.html">bees</a>, q.v.</p>
