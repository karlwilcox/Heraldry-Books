<h1>Escarboucle</h1>
<p>Escarboucle: since the earliest form which we find of this word charboucle, which only in very much later times was corrupted into carbuncle, we must look for its origin in a buckle of some kind. The present form seems to owe its origin to the metal-work on the shield, such as is exhibited on the monumental effigy(commonly ascribed to Geoffrey of Mandeville, Earl of Essex, who died in 1144,) now existing in the Temple church. The effigy, however, can scarcely be earlier than 1185, the date of the consecration of the church. The <a  href="../d/device.html">device</a> being so exactly of the character of the metal-work of the thirteenth century it was no doubt intended by the sculptor to pourtray the ornamental iron-work, which was added to strengthen the shield, the protuberances representing bosses or rivets. That they were not intended for the arms of DE MANDEVILLE is clear, as in the contemporary Rolls of Arms we have his <a  href="../s/shield.html">shield</a> <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> thus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Le comte de MANDEVILE, quartele d'or et de goulez--Roll, temp. HEN. III.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Nor is there any reason to attribute them especially to any knight who is likely to have been buried there. The special figure appears afterwards to have been assumed as a regular device, and it is found amongst the historical arms painted on Queen Elizabeth's tomb in Westminster Abbey, but it is of more ornamental a character than the one on the supposed tomb of Geoffrey Mandeville.</p>
<p class="blazon">Having become a regular device, and borne by several families, it came to have varied nomenclature, and the number of rays was reduced to six and extended to twelve, so that the number came to be mentioned. Some authors have called the <a  href="../r/ray.html">rays</a> staves, nor is this altogether needless, as examples are to be found with the staves blazoned <a  href="../n/nowy.html">nowyed</a>, or <a  href="../p/pometty.html">pometty</a>, and other floretty. In some of the cases, however, the device thus blazoned may be intended for a wheel, but badly drawn.</p>
<a id="238"></a><p class="blazon">The name <a  href="../c/charboucle.html">charboucle</a> is the old form, as will be seen, since it is used in the earliest rolls as well as by Chaucer.</p>
