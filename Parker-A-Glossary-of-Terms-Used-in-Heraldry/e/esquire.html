<h1>Esquire</h1>
<p>Esquire, equire, esquierre, or squire(fr. esquerre, or &eacute;querre): a figure similar in form to a gyron. The <a  href="../c/chief.html">chief</a> examples are those in the arms of MORTIMER(earls of March), which are variously blazoned, each successive heraldic writer attempting to improve upon his predecessor. The following its the description in the Siege of Carlaverock, and it has been thought well to give the English in a paraller column.</p>
<center><pre>    Epuis Rogiers de Mortemer,             |And next Roger de Mortimer,         
    Ki, deca mer e dela mer,               |Who, on both sides the sea,         
    A port&eacute; quel part ke ait al&eacute;           |Has borne wherever he went          
    L'escu barr&eacute; au chief pal&eacute;             |A shield barry with a chief paly    
    E les cornieres gyronn&eacute;es,             |And the corners gyronny,            
    De or e de asur enlumin&eacute;es,            |Emblazoned with gold and blue,      
    O le escuchon vuidie de ermine.        |With the escutcheon voided of       
      Roll of Carlaverock.                 |  ermine.

<p class="blazon">Theoretical heralds say that the esquire may be drawn across the whole shield, but no examples are found; while the expression based or bast esquire has probably arisen from some error, but it is found used by more than one writer. It would have been better if heralds had been content with the old form, corners gyronny.</p>
<p>Esquire, (lat. armiger, fr. escuyer): a title of a gentleman of the rank immediately below a knight. It was originally a military office, an esquire being(as the name escuyer, from escu, a shield, implies) a knight's attendant and shield bearer.</p>
<p class="blazon"><a href="../e/esquire.html">Esquires</a> may be theoretically divided into five classes: 1. The younger sons of peers and their eldest sons. 2. The eldest sons of knights and their eldest sons. 3. The <a  href="../c/chief.html">chiefs</a> of <a  href="../a/ancient.html">ancient</a> families are esquires by prescription. 4. Esquires by creation or office. Such the heralds and serjeants at arms and some others, who are constituted esquires by receiving a collar of SS. Judges and other officers of state, justices of the peace, and the higher naval and military officers are designated esquires in their patents or commissions. Doctors in the several faculties, and barristers at law, are considered as <a href="../e/esquire.html">esquires</a>, or equal to esquires. None, however, of these offices or degrees convey gentility to the posterity of their holders.</p>
<p class="blazon">5. the last kind of <a href="../e/esquire.html">esquires</a> are those of knights of the bath; each knight appoints two to attend upon him at his installation and at coronations.</p>
<p class="blazon">A special helmet was appropriated to esquires.</p>
