<p>Ewer, or laver-pot, (fr. aiguierre, also burette): this and similar charges, such as <a  href="../j/jug.html">jug</a>, and <a  href="../b/beaker.html">beaker</a>, are variously represented. The <a  href="../l/laver-pot.html">laver-pot</a> in the FOUNDERS' Company is represented as below, but the more ordinary form is that given in the margin. The handle(fr. corniere) should be <a  href="../s/sinister.html">sinister</a>, and the lip dexter. This charge does not appear to be represented in any of the ancient rolls of arms by name, but perhaps some of the ancient pots, q.v., were represented like <a  href="../p/pitcher.html">pitchers</a>. The term <a  href="../f/flagon.html">flagon</a> also occurs(fr. flacon probably answers to the same).</p>

<p class="blazon">The old French pichier, the modern pitcher, is found as early as the <a  href="../r/roll.html">roll</a> of the Siege of Carlaverock, but it appears to be a solitary example, and the name of the bearer seems rather to suggest its connection with the <a  href="../w/water-bouget.html">water bouget</a>.</p>
