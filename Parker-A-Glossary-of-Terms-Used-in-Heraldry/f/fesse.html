<p>Fesse, sometimes spelt fess, (fr. fasce): one of the ordinaries, and though not found so frequently perhaps as the <a  href="../b/bend.html">bend</a>, it is used as much as the <a  href="../c/chevron.html">chevron</a>, and if its kindred charge(for this in not allowed to be a diminutive), the bar is taken into account more so. It is the most natural form to be produced in the construction of a shield, though fanciful heralds find an origin for it in the military girdle. It should occupy, according to heraldic rule, one third of the height of the escutcheon, but this proportion is almost always considerably diminished in practice. Its position is across the centre of the shield, unless it is described as <a  href="../e/enhanced.html">enhanced</a>, or <a  href="../a/abased.html">abased</a>.</p>

<p class="blazon">Monsire Symon de COLVIL, porte d'or a une fes de gules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The <a href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a> is subjected to the same series of variations as to its margin as have already been noted under the <a  href="../b/bend.html">bend</a>, &amp;c., and this from earliest times; the <a href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a> <a  href="../d/dancette.html">dancetty</a> was called a dauncet, and when <a  href="../i/indented.html">indented</a> q.v. the number of indentations is sometimes given. It is found <a  href="../h/humetty.html">humetty</a>(q.v.) and even with the ends botonny.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Piers PERCY, d'or ung fece engrele d'azur--Roll, temp. HEN. III.</p>

<p class="blazon">Argent, a fesse botonny gules--ABIBSON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">There cannot properly be more than one fesse in a single coat of arms; if more they are bars; but still, in rare instances, in old blazoning the term <a href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a> is used where bar would be used now; the term a demi-fesse occurs also when it is joined with a <a  href="../c/canton.html">canton</a>. (See under <a  href="../c/canton.html">Canton</a>, <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of PYPARD.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sir John de WAKE, port d'or ov ij fesse de gulez ov iij torteus d'or en la chef.--Falkirk Roll, A.D. 1298, HARL. MS. [But in the Roll in the Cottonian MS. Caligula, A. xviii. A.D. 1308-14, these arms are blazoned, Sire Johan WAKE, de or, a ij barres de goules, en le chef iij rondels de goules].</p>
<p class="blazon">Sir Rauff PIPART, porte d'argent ov ung fees et demy fees et le cantell d'azure; et en le cantell quint foyl d'or--Falkirk Roll, Harl. MS. 6589.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Again, like the <a  href="../c/chevron.html">chevron</a>, the <a href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a> may be <a  href="../a/abased.html">abased</a>, <a  href="../e/enhanced.html">enhanced</a>, &amp;c.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a fesse enhanced and a chevron gules--MACK.</p>

<p class="blazon">And it may be <a  href="../d/debruised.html">debruised</a> or broken, when it would probably be represented as in the margin; though there is much doubt as to the practical application of such terms as <a  href="../d/debruised.html">debruised</a>, <a href="../f/fracted.html">fracted</a>, &amp;c., as has been shewn under the terms <a  href="../b/bend.html">bend</a>, <a  href="../c/chevron.html">chevron</a>, and <a  href="../d/downset.html">downset</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a fesse removed or debruised in the centre argent--BROKROSE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">It may be <a  href="../c/charge.html">charged</a> with various devices, and very rarely is it depressed by other ordinaries, but such cases do occur.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a fesse ermine depressed by a pale of the same within a bordure engrailed azure--SPONNE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, a fesse chequy azure and argent, over all a bend engrailed gules within a bordure of the third charged with eight mullets of the second--STUART, co. Oxon.</p>
</blockquote>
<a id="253"></a><p class="blazon"><a  href="../p/party.html">Party</a> per fesse(fr. coup&eacute;) is very rare in comparison with <a  href="../p/party.html">party</a> per pale. While the division into three horizontal portions(fr. tierc&eacute;), though comparatively common in French arms, is seldom if ever found in English examples. See <a  href="../p/party.html">Party</a>.</p>
<p class="blazon">Fesswise, or fessways, is used to signify that a charge, the normal position of which is upright, is placed lengthways.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a sword lying fesswise proper, hilt and pomel or, the hilt towards the sinister between three fleur-de-lis of the last--BROWNE, Scotland.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/253a.png" alt="DOLBEN." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">DOLBEN.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="blazon">Fesse-wards signifies that the charge, or charges, are to be placed with the <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a> or points towards the centre of the shield, i.e. the fesse-point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sable, a close helmet between three spear-heads, points fesse-wards--DOLBEN, Bp. of Bangor, 1632.</p>
