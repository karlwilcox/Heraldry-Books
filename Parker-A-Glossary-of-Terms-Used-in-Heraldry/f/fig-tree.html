<h1>Fig-tree</h1>
<p>Fig-tree, (fr. figue): the tree and the leaves occur, but no instance of the fruit being borne in English arms has been observed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Per fesse wavy gules and argent, in chief a lion passant guardant erminois, in base on a mount vert a fig-tree proper--MIRTLE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Per chevron argent and gules, three fig-leaves counterchanged--GREVES.</p>
