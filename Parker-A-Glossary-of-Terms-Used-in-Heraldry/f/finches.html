<h1>Finches</h1>
<p>Finches: beneath this term it has been thought well to comprise a number of birds of the finch tribe, examples of which are found in heraldic blazon. In many cases only single instances have been met with, and some appear to have been adopted only for the sake of the name. They are as follows, and for the sake of reference to foreign arms the scientific names according to Linn&aelig;us have been added to each: The <a  href="../g/goldfinch.html">Goldfinch</a>(carduelis); the <a  href="../b/bulfinch.html">Bulfinch</a>(pyrrhula); the <a  href="../c/chaffinch.html">Chaffinch</a>(fringilla c&oelig;Â“lebs); the <a  href="../b/brambling.html">Brambling</a>(fringilla montifringilla); the <a  href="../c/canary.html">Canary</a>(fringilla canaria); the <a  href="../l/linnet.html">Linnet</a>(fringilla cannabina), and the Pinzon. This last is the only one of the series which occurs in any of the old rolls, and it has evidently been chosen for the sake of the name. It is not quite certain what is the bird meant, but it has been supposed to be the chaffinch, i.e. the modern fr. pinson. It has not, however, been found possible to fix upon the equivalents of the above in the French lists of arms.</p>
