<p>Fire-chest: a figure resembling an <a  href="../i/iron.html">iron</a> box used to contain fire to warm a hall is drawn as in the margin in Berry's <a  href="../h/heraldry.html">Heraldry</a>, and attributed as a <a  href="../c/crest.html">crest</a> to one of the families of PRYCE. It is said to have been blazoned as a fire-beacon, but probably its use was domestic, not military.</p>
