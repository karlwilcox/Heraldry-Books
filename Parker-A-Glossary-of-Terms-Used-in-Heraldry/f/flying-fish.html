<p>Flying-fish, (lat. esocetus, a branch of the genus esox, established by Linn&aelig;us, which includes the pike). until a comparatively recent period this fish was drawn, not as it appears naturally, but more like a <a  href="../h/herring.html">herring</a> with the <a  href="../w/wings.html">wing</a> of a <a  href="../b/birds.html">bird</a>. Foreign examples are more frequent than in England, only two families here having been noticed bearing this device.</p>
