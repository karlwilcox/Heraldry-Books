<h1>Foil</h1>
<p>Foil, (lat. folium, fr. feuille), but borne only in compounds.</p>
<p class="blazon"><a  href="../u/unifoil.html">Unifoil</a>: a charge which probably never existed anywhere but in the fancy of Randle Holme, who says that it is like a single leaf of the trefoil. The <a  href="../t/twyfoil.html">twyfoil</a> no doubt derived its origin from the same or a similar source. Under their heads are given Trefoil, Quatrefoil, Cinquefoil, Sexfoil.</p>
<p class="blazon"><a  href="../h/huitfoil.html">Huit-foil</a>, <a  href="../e/eight-foil.html">Eight-foil</a>, or Double quatrefoil: said to be used as a mark of cadency, but no example has been met with.</p>
