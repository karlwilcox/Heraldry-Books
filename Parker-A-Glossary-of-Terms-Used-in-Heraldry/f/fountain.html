<h1>Fountain</h1>
<p>Fountain: this conventional device is supposed to represent a well or spring of water, and might generally be <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as a <a  href="../r/roundles.html">roundle</a> <a  href="../b/barry.html">barry</a> <a  href="../w/wavy.html">wavy</a> of six argent and azure. That this is so is evidenced from so many families of WELLS bearing it. The family of SYKES also <a  href="../b/bear.html">bear</a> it in allusion to the old name of <a  href="../s/sykes.html">sykes</a> for a <a  href="../w/well.html">well</a>. Guillim also says that the six fountains given to the family of STOURTON represent six springs, whereof the river Stour in Wiltshire hath its beginning.</p>

<p class="blazon">Practically the well is sometimes for the <a href="../f/fountain.html">fountain</a>, but the former should properly be masoned, i.e. should shew the stone-work, while the heraldic fountain is supposed to represent the water in the well only. Fountaine with the French, however, is used for a <a href="../f/fountain.html">fountain</a>, i.e. masonry, with a jet of water.</p>
