<p>Fox: occurs somewhat frequently as an heraldic charge. The <a  href="../t/tod.html">tod</a> is a local name; hence borne by the family of TODD.</p>

<a id="274"></a><p class="blazon">With the <a href="../f/fox.html">fox</a> may be classed the genet, an animal somewhat resembling it, but considerably smaller, and usually grey spotted with <a  href="../b/black.html">black</a>. It was highly valued on account of its skin, and is made to be the badge of an order of knighthood said, according to the legend, to have been instituted by Charles Martel, king of France, in the year 726. The <a  href="../c/chief.html">chief</a> instance known of its use is in the Plantagenet badge of a genet passing between two broom-trees(or Plant&oelig; genist&oelig;), given by Edward IV. to his illegitimate son, Arthur Plantagenet, the badge thus providing a double pun.</p>
