<h1>Furs</h1>
<p>Furs, (fr. fourrures, also <a  href="../p/pannes.html">pannes</a>): there are several varieties. Ermine, ermines, erminites, and erminois have already been noted with <a  href="../p/pean.html">pean</a> under <a  href="../e/ermine.html">Ermine</a>. Vair, and in irregular for named Potent counter potent, will be described in their alphabetical order. All these are conventional representations of skins of divers animals, or portions of the skins sewn together in divers forms. Being mixed tinctures, that is, consisting both of <a  href="../m/metal.html">metal</a>(although not considered as such) and colour, they may be placed upon either, and conversely metal and colour may equally be placed upon them.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a href="../f/furs.html">furs</a> recognised in French heraldry are hermine proper, contre hermine(which is the reverse), and hermines of different tinctures(which are described), and the vair. The <a  href="../p/pannes.html">pannes</a> is rather a general name for mixed fur; perhaps in its origin having a reference to the lining of mantles, &amp;c.</p>
