<h1>Fusil</h1>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/278a.png" alt="Fusils." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Fusils.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Fusil, (fr. fuseau and fus&eacute;e), in its natural form and sense, in a spindle belonging to a distaff; but in its conventional form it is an elongated lozenge, and very often the one charge is mistaken for the other. In different arms they are differently drawn, and in the same <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> at different dates they are variously represented. In an <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">ordinary</a> way the conventional fusil is the one to be drawn. In French armorial blazon the name <a href="../f/fuseau.html">fuseau</a> seems to be reserved for the true spindle, while the fus&eacute;e is used for the conventional form. In its primitive form, as in the arms of BADLAND, afterwards assumed by HOBY, it is represented as in the margin(fig. 1). The family of TREFUSIS bear another variety of the fusil(fig. 2); but the usual term for such is spindle, q.v.; while the heraldic fusil is drawn as fig. 3. The <a href="../f/fusil.html">fusil</a> does not appear in the rolls of arms, so far as been observed, before the time of Edward III.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Monsire de MONTAGUE, Count de Sarum, port d'argent trois fusilles gules--Roll, temp. ED. III.</p>
<p class="blazon">Monsire DAWTRYNE, port de sable a une fes fusile de v points d'argent--Ibid.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three fusils(or spindles) in fesse gules threaded or--HOBY, Bisham.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron between three ancient fusils(or wharrow spindles) sable--TREFUSIS.</p>
</blockquote>
<a id="279"></a><p class="blazon">Compared with the <a  href="../l/lozenge.html">lozenge</a> and the mascle the fusil should always be represented narrower in proportion to its height, but, whatever rules may be laid down, they are seldom adhered to, as the disposition of the fusils and shape of the shield oblige modifications.</p>
<p class="blazon"><a href="../f/fusil.html">Fusils</a> are most frequently borne <a  href="../c/conjoined.html">conjoined</a> in the form of a <a href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a>, a <a  href="../b/bend.html">bend</a>, a <a  href="../c/cross.html">cross</a>, or of a <a  href="../s/saltire.html">saltire</a>.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../b/bend.html">bend</a> <a href="../f/fusil.html">fusil</a> should consist of about five entire fusils, and two halves, each individual fusil being placed bend-sinisterwise. The <a href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a> <a href="../f/fusil.html">fusil</a> should have five perfect fusils, and the cross, as already pointed out(see <a  href="../c/cross.html">cross</a>,  &sect;8), should consist of nine, five of which should be <a  href="../e/entire.html">entire</a>. But, as will be observed, an ordinary is often described "of so many fusils."</p>

<p class="blazon">In the <a href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a> the <a href="../f/fusil.html">fusils</a> are naturally all upright; in the bend they are drawn at right angles to the diagonal line passing across the shield; in a cross of fusils all the fusils are placed upright; while in a saltire they diverge from the fesse points.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Or, five fusils conjoined in fesse azure--PENNINGTON, Muncaster, Cumb.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Further, there is much inconsistency in nomenclature. A <a href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a>, <a  href="../b/bend.html">bend</a>, or <a  href="../c/cross.html">cross</a> <a href="../f/fusil.html">fusil</a>, is used instead of a <a href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a>, <a  href="../b/bend.html">bend</a>, or <a  href="../c/cross.html">cross</a>, composed of so many fusils: fusilly also is often written with the same meaning, but, as <a  href="../p/point.html">pointed</a> out under <a  href="../c/cross.html">cross</a>,  &sect;8, it is incorrect.</p>

<p class="blazon">Fusilly(fr. fusil&eacute;) is a well-defined term applied to the <a href="../f/field.html">field</a>, and the two tinctures must be named, as in the arms of PATTEN given below. The application of this term to a series of fusils(with one tincture only named) is consequently entirely wrong, but custom has so completely sanctioned it(no doubt through carelessness in the first instance) that the error has become almost the rule.</p>

<a id="281"></a><p class="blazon">No case has been noticed in which when the term fusilly is applied to an <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">ordinary</a> two tinctures are named; as all the examples appear with one tincture, the term fusilly must be read 'of so many fusils.'</p>
