<p>Gore: a portion of the shield obliterated, so to speak, as represented in the margin; it may be either on the dexter or sinister side. If the former, it is supposed to be an honourable charge, but if the latter, and when <a  href="../t/tenne.html">tenn&eacute;</a>, it is an abatement for cowardice in battle; but though writers descant upon their use, they give no examples, probably because there are none. Guillim calls it "one of the whymsical abatements." See also <a href="../g/gusset.html">Gusset</a>.</p>
