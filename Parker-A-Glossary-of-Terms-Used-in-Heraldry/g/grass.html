<blockquote>

<p class="blazon">Argent, three tufts of grass vert--TYLSLEY, co, York.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, three tufts of grass or--SYKES.</p>

<p class="blazon">The term <a href="../g/graminy.html">graminy</a> is also found, which signifies made of grass, and is applied to the <a  href="../c/chaplet.html">chaplet</a>, under which an example is given.</p>
