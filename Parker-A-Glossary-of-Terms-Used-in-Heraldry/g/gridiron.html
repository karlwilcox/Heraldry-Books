<p>Gridiron: this device is represented as in the margin, but is rarely borne. In the first of the three instances named below it has been chosen for the device of the Company of GIRDLERS(in whose arms the gridiron is figured somewhat differently from the ordinary shape). The reason of the Company bearing this device was no doubt that S.Laurence was their patron saint. Sir Thomas SCOTT may have been a member of the Company.</p>
