<h1>Griffin</h1>
<p>Griffin, or Gryphon, (fr. griffon): the Griffin is the most frequently represented of the imaginary animals introduced into coats of arms. Although variously drawn, the great principle is that it is a compound of the Lion and the Eagle. The lower part of its body, with the <a  href="../t/tail.html">tail</a> and the hind-legs, belong to the lion; the <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a> and the fore-part, with the <a  href="../l/leg.html">legs</a> and talons, to those of the eagle, but the head retains the ears of the lion. It has large wings, which also closely resemble those of the eagle. Its ordinary positions are rampant segreant(generally <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> <a  href="../s/segreant.html">segreant</a> only), and passant segreant.</p>

<p class="blazon">It may be represented as without <a  href="../w/wings.html">wings</a>, and then with <a  href="../r/ray.html">rays</a> or spikes of gold proceeding from several parts of its body. Sometimes it has two long straight horns. The term <a  href="../a/alce.html">Alce</a> is given, as if used by writers for a kind of <a href="../g/griffin.html">griffin</a>, but no example can be quoted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a griffin segreant or--READ, Herts.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a griffin segreant, or--RIVERS, Earl of Devon.</p>
</blockquote>
<a id="295"></a><p class="blazon">The representation on the shield of READ is, according to the mode of drawing the griffin, sometimes seen, but the example taken from the supporters to the arms of Alexander ANNAND of Elton is the more usual way of drawing the animal.</p>
<p class="blazon"><a href="../g/griffin.html">Griffins'</a> <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a> are also represented in some coats. They are readily distinguishable from the eagles' <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a> by the presence of the ears.</p>

<a id="296"></a><p class="blazon">The <a  href="../d/dragon.html">Dragon</a>(fr. <a  href="../d/dragon.html">dragon</a>), the next in importance to the griffin amongst the fictitious animals, seems perhaps to have had its origin in the stories brought by travellers who, on their way to the Holy Land, may have seen the crocodiles on the banks of the Nile, and exaggerated or idealized the form; and probably the word, in some of the instances in which it is used in the Bible, means the <a  href="../c/crocodile.html">crocodile</a>.</p>
<p class="blazon">Represented usually like the <a href="../g/griffin.html">griffin</a>, that is, rampant, its head is that of a serpent, of which an essential addition in the forked tongue. It has also, like the <a href="../g/griffin.html">griffin</a>, <a  href="../e/ear.html">ears</a>. The body, as to its proportions, is that of a lion, but it is represented scaled, and the large wings, instead of being those of an eagle, are webbed and pointed, and resemble rather those of the bat. The <a  href="../l/leg.html">legs</a> are also scaled, and the feet are represented usually with webbed talons, instead of those of the eagle; a <a  href="../s/spur.html">spur</a>, however, is often added. The <a  href="../t/tail.html">tail</a>, instead of ending like that of a lion, is a tuft, is always represented as <a  href="../b/barbed.html">barbed</a> in English arms, but in French arms it is sometimes represented as with a fish-tail, and twisted. The <a  href="../d/dragon.html">dragon</a> may be also represented 'sans' <a  href="../w/wings.html">wings</a>.</p>
<p class="blazon"><a  href="../d/dragons-head.html">Dragon's heads</a> frequently occur as <a  href="../c/charge.html">charges</a>: the presence of the ears and of the barbed tongue distinguishes them from the heads of eagles or serpents.</p>

<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../d/dragon.html">Dragon</a>, like the <a href="../g/griffin.html">Griffin</a>, if often used as a <a  href="../c/crest.html">crest</a>, or as one of the supporters. The illustration here given is from one of the supporters to the arms of William HUGHES, of Gwerclas.</p>
<a id="297"></a><p class="blazon">A sea-Dragon appears on the crest of Sir Jacob Gerrard, Bart. 1662.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../o/opinicus.html">Opinicus</a> is allied more nearly to the dragon in the forepart and in the wings; but it has a beaked head and ears, something between the dragon and the griffin. The <a  href="../h/hind.html">hind</a> part and the four legs are probably intended to represent those of a lion, but the tail is short, and is said to be that of the camel.</p>

<p class="blazon">Two opinici vert, beaked sable, wings gules, are Supporters to the Insignia of the PLASTERERS' Company.</p>
