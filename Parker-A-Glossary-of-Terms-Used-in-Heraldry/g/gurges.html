<p>Gurges, or Whirlpool: as the <a href="../g/gurges.html">gurges</a>(like the <a  href="../f/fountain.html">fountain</a>) represents water, argent and azure are its proper tinctures. Instances, however, occur in which other tinctures are employed.</p>
<p class="blazon">In an <a  href="../a/ancient.html">ancient</a> <a  href="../r/roll.html">roll</a> of <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> the <a  href="../w/whirlpool.html">whirlpool</a> is represented not as a continued line, but as a number of rings one within another, and it is probable that, by the term roel&eacute; in the arms of GORGES in the early roll, the same <a  href="../c/charge.html">charge</a> is meant, though the term rouel is found in other rolls with a different signification.</p>
