<h1>Gurnet</h1>
<p>Gurnet, gournet, or gurnard(lat. trigla): this fish, found on our coats, occurs in the crest of one Norfolk family and in the arms of one Cornish family; in the latter case on account of the local name by which it is known, namely, tubbe fish. With it may be associated the mullet, which is sometimes found <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> in the arms of WAYE, and the French rouget, which appears to include both kinds of <a  href="../f/fish.html">fish</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Or a chapeau gules turned down ermine, a gurnet fish in pale with the head downwards--Crest of GURNEY, Norfolk.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron sable between three gournets[or tubbe fish] hauriant gules--TUBB, Trengoff, Cornwall, granted 1571.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a cross engrailed gules, between four mullets of the second[probably the fish]--GORNEY.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three mullets hauriant argent[elsewhere three fish, and in one case three lucies]--WAYE, or WEYE, Dorset.</p>
