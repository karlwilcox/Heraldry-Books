<p>Gusset, (fr. gousset, the armpit): this truncation of the shield, like the <a href="../g/gore.html">gore</a>, occurs usually on either the dexter or sinister side. In the former case(when <a  href="../s/sanguine.html">sanguine</a>) it is imagined to be an abatement for adultery, in the latter for drunkenness. Gussets, however, occur as honourable charges. When in base, the term <a href="../g/graft.html">graft</a> seems preferable.</p>
