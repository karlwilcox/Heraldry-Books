<h1>Hare</h1>
<p>Hare: the Hare(fr. li&egrave;vre). as also the <a  href="../r/rabbit.html">rabbit</a>(fr. <a  href="../l/lapin.html">lapin</a>), always blazoned <a  href="../c/coney.html">coney</a>(and in one case the leveret), are not infrequent in coats of arms, but, so far as has been observed, there are no rules followed as to distinct drawing of these varieties.</p>
<a id="307"></a><p class="blazon">They are more frequently represented as <a  href="../s/sejant.html">sejant</a>, and if no description is given they would be drawn so; but they are found <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> <a  href="../c/courant.html">courant</a>, <a  href="../b/boltant.html">boltant</a>, <a  href="../p/passant.html">passant</a>, <a  href="../s/salient.html">salient</a>, and(though wrongly) rampant; also feeding, and issuing from their burrows; the most remarkable of all is the hare playing upon the bagpipes(q.v.). Hares' <a href="../h/head.html">heads</a> occur in one case.</p>
