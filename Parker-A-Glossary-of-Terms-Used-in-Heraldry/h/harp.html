<p>Harp, (fr. harpe): this charge is best known as the <a  href="../e/ensign.html">ensign</a> of the kingdom of IRELAND, but is borne also by one or two families. It first appears crowned amongst the royal badges on the accession of the Stuarts. The <a href="../h/head.html">head</a> and wings of an angel have been added in late examples, but without authority. The Irish name <a  href="../c/cloyshacke.html">cloyshackes</a> seems to be applied in one MS. to the harp(see under <a  href="../i/ireland.html">Ireland</a>). We also find the <a  href="../j/jews-harp.html">Jew's harp</a> mentioned, but it is doubtful if it is not meant(as the name of the bearer implies) for a scoop.</p>
