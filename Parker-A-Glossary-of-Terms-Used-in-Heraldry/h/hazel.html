<h1>Hazel</h1>
<p>Hazel, the tree, the leaves, the nuts, are all represented in different arms; the <a  href="../f/filberts.html">filberts</a> also. A <a  href="../c/chaplet.html">chaplet</a> is sometimes composed of hazel, and a squirrel is sometimes represented cracking nuts. A bunch of filberts is in French blazon called coquerelles.</p>
