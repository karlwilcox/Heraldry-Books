<p>Head, (fr. t&ecirc;te): as will have been noticed, the heads of beasts, birds, and fishes are very frequently represented by themselves, being couped, or erased; but it has been thought well to group under one article the various forms of the human head as they appear in heraldic design, and it has been observed they are very frequent in the arms of Welsh families. It may be said generally that, unless otherwise specified, the human head(as well as <a href="../h/head.html">heads</a> of <a  href="../b/beasts.html">beasts</a>) should be drawn in profile. In English arms the heads are usually blazoned <a  href="../p/proper.html">proper</a>; in French arms the tincture is usually named, i.e. <a  href="../c/carnation.html">carnation</a>. The following are the representative types of these charges, of which it is thought well to give examples. Besides men's <a href="../h/head.html">heads</a> <a  href="../p/proper.html">proper</a>, which are generally represented as those of old men with <a href="../h/hair.html">hair</a>(fr. <a  href="../c/cheville.html">chevel&eacute;e</a>), and bearded(fr. barb&eacute;e), and young men's <a href="../h/head.html">heads</a>(see example under <a  href="../m/mascle.html">mascle</a>), we find various heads specified, as of Englishmen, of Saxons, of Princes, of Saracens(as in the crest of DRAYTON), of Turks, of Moors, or blackamoors and negroes, of the gypsy or Egyptian, and finally of savages' <a href="../h/head.html">heads</a>. In one case a bald head is given. There seem to be no very defined rules for drawing the respective heads, much being left to the ingenuity of the artist; still in many of the arms as exhibited in sculpture or in glass the heads are very characteristic.</p>

<a id="313"></a><p class="blazon">Amongst peculiar examples may be named Moses' <a href="../h/head.html">head</a> and the head of John the Baptist in a charger. The former, however, is borne only as a <a  href="../c/crest.html">crest</a>, that is to say, by the family of HILTON, and the engraving is taken from the carving on the eastern front of Hilton Castle, Durham. The latter appears as the <a  href="../c/crest.html">crest</a> of the London Company of TALLOWCHANDLERS, adopted, no doubt, in consequence of S.John the Baptist being chosen as their patron Saint; it is also borne by the <a  href="../t/town.html">town</a> of Ayr in Scotland(see the <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> given under <a  href="../l/lamb.html">Lamb</a>). Again, a peculiar head appears as the <a  href="../c/crest.html">crest</a> of Sir Sandich de TRANE, knight-founder of the <a  href="../g/garter.html">Garter</a>(that is to say one of the first knights of the order); it is blazoned sometimes as a Satyr's <a href="../h/head.html">head</a>, and the <a  href="../d/device.html">device</a> appears also in a coat of arms. Other fanciful heads occur as <a  href="../c/crest.html">crests</a>, e.g. a Fiend's <a href="../h/head.html">head</a>(<a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> also 'Satan's <a href="../h/head.html">head</a>'), i.e. a men's <a href="../h/head.html">head</a> with <a  href="../e/ear.html">ears</a> like a <a  href="../d/dragon.html">dragon's</a> <a  href="../w/wings.html">wings</a>, and a <a  href="../w/whittals-head.html">Whittal's head</a>, said to be a man's <a href="../h/head.html">head</a> with short horns, and called by Anstis 'the head of Midas, with asses' <a  href="../e/ear.html">ears</a>.'</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Of Women's <a href="../h/head.html">heads</a> there are also several varieties. As a rule they are drawn with dishevelled hair. The maidens' <a href="../h/head.html">heads</a> are drawn as the <a href="../h/head.html">head</a> and shoulders of a woman affronty, couped below the breasts, her <a href="../h/hair.html">hair</a> dishevelled, and usually wreathed with a <a  href="../g/garland.html">garland</a> of <a  href="../r/rose.html">roses</a>; sometimes also <a  href="../c/crown.html">crowned</a> with an eastern crown. The term <a  href="../b/bust.html">bust</a> is also sometimes used in English, but more frequently in French blazon. The term lady's <a href="../h/head.html">head</a> is also found, as also <a  href="../n/nuns-head.html">nun's head</a>, the last being generally veiled.</p>

<p class="blazon"><a  href="../i/infant.html">Infants'</a>, and children's, and boys' <a href="../h/head.html">heads</a> are also found named, frequently with a <a  href="../s/snake.html">snake</a> twisted around the neck.</p>

<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../s/seraph.html">Seraph's</a> <a href="../h/head.html">head</a> is said to be represented as the <a href="../h/head.html">head</a> of an <a  href="../i/infant.html">infant</a> with six wings, two above it in saltire, two below it in saltire, and one on each side, but so far as has been observed no example occurs. Death's <a href="../h/head.html">heads</a> are but rarely borne(see under <a  href="../b/bones.html">Bones</a>).</p>
