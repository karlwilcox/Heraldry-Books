<h1>Hemp-break</h1>
<p>Hemp-break, or Hemp-hackle(also <a  href="../f/flax-breaker.html">Flax-breaker</a>), was the device of Sir Reginald BRAY, and is seen upon the vaulting of S.George's <a  href="../c/chapel.html">chapel</a> at Windsor. This machine for pounding the hemp seems, like many other devices, to be borne on account of the name, the old word bray signifying to bruise or pound(see Proverbs xxvii. 22). From the form it has been confused with the <a  href="../b/breys.html">breys</a> or barnacles, q.v.</p>
