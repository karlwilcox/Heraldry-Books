<h1>Hercules</h1>
<p>Hercules: this figure occurs on one coat of arms, and one only, so far as has been observed. He is represented as holding a quadrant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, the figure of Hercules[in one blazon 'a savage'] wreathed about the head and middle with laurel-leaves, holding in the dexter hand a quadrant, and therewith looking towards a star in the dexter chief; and in the sinister hand holding a club all proper--OSWALD, Scotland.</p>
