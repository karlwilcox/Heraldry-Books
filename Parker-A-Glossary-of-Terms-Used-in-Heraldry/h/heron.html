<h1>Heron</h1>
<p>Heron, (fr. h&eacute;ron): this and its allies the hernshaw, bittern, and fencock, are borne by several families; but, as will be seen in most cases, allusively. Probably no great distinction can be made in the several drawings except, perhaps, in the case of the spoonbill; indeed, there appears to be some confusion in blazoning the arms bearing these devices, and a further confusion between such and those bearing the crane and the stork. It will, however, be seen that the Heron proper is found in arms of ancient date. It is generally drawn standing but rare examples occur of it being blazoned <a  href="../v/volant.html">volant</a>.</p>
