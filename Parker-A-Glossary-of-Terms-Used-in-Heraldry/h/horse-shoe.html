<h1>Horse-shoe</h1>
<p>Horse-shoe, (fr. fer-de-cheval): the horse-shoe is found as a <a  href="../c/charge.html">charge</a> amongst the earliest arms we have. There are usually six or eight nail-holes, which should be of the <a  href="../t/tincture.html">tincture</a> of the <a  href="../f/field.html">field</a>; but when of another tincture probably it is intended for that of the nails(fr. clou&eacute;).</p>
