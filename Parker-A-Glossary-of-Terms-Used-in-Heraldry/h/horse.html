<h1>Horse</h1>
<p>Horse, (fr. cheval): the horse does not occur in ancient rolls of arms, and less often than would be expected in modern coats. It is represented as standing(or upright), as <a  href="../t/trotting.html">trotting</a>, as <a  href="../c/courant.html">courant</a>, or in full career(fr. galoppant, &eacute;chapp&eacute;), and as <a  href="../s/salient.html">salient</a>, or <a  href="../r/rearing.html">rearing</a>(fr. accul&eacute; and cabr&eacute;, also <a  href="../e/effare.html">effar&eacute;</a>): it may be <a  href="../s/saddle.html">saddled</a>(fr. <a  href="../s/selle.html">sell&eacute;</a>), and bridled(fr. brid&eacute;); also the general terms for harnessed, and with <a  href="../t/trappings.html">trappings</a>, are found in French bard&eacute;, houss&eacute;, and capara&ccedil;onn&eacute;, while the French term <a  href="../g/gai.html">gai</a> is used when the <a href="../h/horse.html">horse</a> is at liberty, without any harness whatever.</p>
<p class="blazon">In English arms the horse is sometimes represented as <a  href="../s/spancelled.html">spancelled</a>, a term used when two of its legs are fettered to a log of wood. Very frequently only horses' <a href="../h/head.html">heads</a> are given. The term <a  href="../n/nag.html">nag</a> is sometimes used for a <a href="../h/horse.html">horse</a>, and <a  href="../c/colt.html">colt</a> also appears as a <a  href="../c/charge.html">charge</a>. A <a href="../h/horse.html">horse</a> is borne in the insignia of the House of Hanover, and is found <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as the <a  href="../w/white.html">White</a> <a href="../h/horse.html">horse</a> of Hanover.</p>
