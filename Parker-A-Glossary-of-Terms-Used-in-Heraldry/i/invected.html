<p>Invected, invecked, envecked, or invecqued: the reverse of engrailed, the points being turned inwards. Although engrailed occurs frequently in ancient rolls of arms, no case has been observed of invected, and, indeed, it is somewhat rare in modern arms, and it is doubtful if it occurs in French arms.</p>
