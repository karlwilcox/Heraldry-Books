<h1>Key</h1>
<p>Key, (fr. clef): is a very common bearing in the insignia of sees and religious houses, especially such as are under the patronage of S.Peter; in other arms they are supposed to denote office in the state.</p>
<a id="343"></a><p class="blazon"><a href="../k/keys.html">Keys</a> borne singly are usually in pale, and as two keys can be placed in a variety of ways the particular way must be expressed. More frequently the two are borne in saltire(fr. pass&eacute;es en sautoir), but they may be <a  href="../a/addorsed.html">addorsed</a>(fr. adoss&eacute;es). Further, it is necessary sometimes to state on which <a  href="../s/side.html">side</a> the wards(fr. pannetons) of the keys should be drawn. When no direction is given, the key is drawn erect: i.e. with the <a  href="../b/bow.html">bow</a> in base. Keys may be <a  href="../i/interlaced.html">interlaced</a> in the bows, or rings.</p>
