<p>King: the title and position of the King has given rise to much discourse by heraldic writers, but there is nothing very practical to be derived from such discourses. The <a href="../k/king.html">King's</a> <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> have already been treated of under <a  href="../a/arms.html">Arms</a> royal, the Kings of arms under <a  href="../h/herald.html">Heralds</a>. It should, however, be observed that on one or two coats of arms a King is borne as a <a  href="../c/charge.html">charge</a>, and generally a full description is given.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, on a mount a bear standing against a tree all proper, the bear collared and chained or, between two escutcheons in fesse, each charged wit the arms of France and England quarterly; on a chief argent a king crowned and habited proper holding in his dexter hand a mound and in the sinister a sceptre both or--Town of BERWICK-UPON-TWEED.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, a king enthroned proper--IRELAND; Harl. MS. 4039.</p>
