<h1>Kings of Cologne</h1>

<p>Kings of Cologne, The Three. The three Magi, or Wise Men, in the legendary account, are changed into three Kings, and their bodies were supposed to have been brought by the Empress Helena to Constantinople, afterwards transferred to Milan, and in 1164, on the taking of Milan, presented by the Emperor Frederick to the Abp. of Cologne. No doubt the offerings given at this shrine which enclosed them went a long way to erect Cologne Cathedral. The names usually ascribed to them are Jaspar, Melchior, and Balthasar.</p>
