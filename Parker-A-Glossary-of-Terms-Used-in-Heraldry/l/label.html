<p>Label, (fr. lambel, in old fr. lambell, labell, and labeu): a charge generally considered to be a temporary mark of cadency, q.v. In the <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">ordinary</a> system of differences a label of three points(which has also been termed a <a  href="../f/file.html">file</a> with three labels) is the distinction of the eldest son during the lifetime of his father. In the oldest rolls of arms the labels are all of five points; but labels of three points were at an early period used interchangeably. The theories respecting two extra points being borne to mark the surviving generations will not hold.</p>
<p class="blazon"><a href="../l/label.html">Labels</a> have been supposed by some to represent the collar and cape of a garment, with several pendent labels of tongues, which were worn hanging from the back part of the neck, over the surcoat or tabard.</p>

<p class="blazon"><a  href="../k/king.html">King</a> EDWARD I. before his accession differenced his <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> with a <a href="../l/label.html">label</a> <a  href="../a/azure.html">azure</a>, sometimes of five points, and sometimes(even on the same <a  href="../s/seal.html">seal</a>) of three points.</p>
<a id="360"></a><p class="blazon">EDMUND Plantagenet, called Crouchback, earl of Lancaster, the second son of Henry III., bore England with a <a href="../l/label.html">label</a>, sometimes(as his <a  href="../s/seal.html">seal</a> testifies) of three points, and at other times of five points, as upon his monument at Westminster. In both instances each points is charged with three fleurs-de-lis.</p>
<p class="blazon">The earliest instances on record of the use of the label in England appear to be following:--</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">England, with a label of five points azure--Geoffery PLANTAGENET, earl of Anjou, Poictiers, Britanny, and Richmond, fourth son of King Henry II., borne 1159, and died 1186.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">After this date the label is frequently noticed.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Besides being used as mere temporary marks of cadency, labels are also employed as permanent distinctions, this is to say, they are borne by every member of some particular branches of certain families, just as any other charge is borne.</p>

<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../p/point.html">points</a> were first straight, then patt&eacute;e, and at last labels were formed as they generally are at the present day, without any connection with the <a  href="../s/side.html">sides</a> of the <a  href="../s/shield.html">shield</a>, the <a  href="../p/point.html">points</a> <a  href="../d/dovetailed.html">dovetailed</a>.</p>
<p class="blazon">In latter times the shape of the label was sometimes varied, nor was it confined to three or five points(or drops, as they are sometimes irregularly called). The <a href="../l/label.html">labels</a> were terminated also in other charges, e.g. <a  href="../b/bell.html">bells</a>. And one of three points, each formed as a <a  href="../p/plain.html">plain</a> <a  href="../c/cross.html">cross</a> and charged with five escallops argent, was borne by <a  href="../j/john.html">John</a> de FOIX, Earl of Kendal, 1449.
