<h1>Lamb</h1>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/362b.png" alt="The Holy Lamb." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">The Holy Lamb.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Lamb, (fr. agneau): when represented <a  href="../p/passant.html">passant</a>, the <a  href="../f/faces.html">face</a> is shewn in profile; but when the Holy or Paschal Lamb is intended then the face should be <a  href="../g/guardant.html">guardant</a> or reguardant.</p>
<p class="blazon">This bearing varies considerably in different examples, particularly in the shape of the flag, but the annexed figure may be considered as a fair type. The <a  href="../n/nimbus.html">nimbus</a> should be <a  href="../g/gold.html">gold</a>, with a <a  href="../r/red.html">red</a> <a  href="../c/cross.html">cross</a>: the flag argent, cross and ends gules. The <a  href="../h/holy-lamb.html">Holy Lamb</a> is, however, not unfrequently borne all of one colour.</p>
