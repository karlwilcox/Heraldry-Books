<h1>Latticed</h1>
<p>Latticed. (fr. treillis&eacute;, or treill&eacute;, also fancifully called <a  href="../p/portcullis.html">portcullised</a>): a pattern said to resemble fretty, but placed crossways, and closer; also that it may be <a  href="../i/interlaced.html">interlaced</a> or not, and that it is sometimes <a  href="../c/cloue.html">clou&eacute;</a> or nailed at each intersection, but the term is seldom, if ever, used by English heralds.</p>
