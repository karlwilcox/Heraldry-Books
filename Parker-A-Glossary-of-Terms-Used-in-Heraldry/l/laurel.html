<h1>Laurel</h1>
<p>Laurel, (fr. laurier): branches of this plant have been granted for military services, and sprigs of laurel are also found named. The <a  href="../w/wreath.html">wreaths</a> of <a href="../l/laurel.html">laurel</a>, or <a  href="../b/bay.html">bay</a>, have already been noted as 'crowns triumphal' under <a  href="../c/chaplet.html">Chaplet</a>. But the leaves only(q.v.) occur most frequently, and these often blazoned as <a  href="../b/bay-leaf.html">bay-leaves</a>.</p>
