<h1>Lily</h1>
<p>Lily: next to be the rose the lily is perhaps the most frequently borne of all the flowers, and there is probably little question that this flower is the original of the fleur-de-lis, which took a conventional form. By some the figure so frequently found is supposed to represent the Iris and not the Lily.</p>

<p class="blazon">The three lilies represented on the chief in the arms of the COOPERS' Company(see under <a  href="../g/grose.html">Grose</a>) are figured usually as in the margin. The French heralds use the term <a href="../l/lis.html">Lis</a> de jardin, or au naturel, to distinguish the natural lily from the conventional fleur-de-lis.</p>
