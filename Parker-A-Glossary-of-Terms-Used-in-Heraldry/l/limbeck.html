<p>Limbeck, or Alembick: the charge represented in the annexed cut is so termed by numerous heraldic writers, but the connection between the name and the figure is not very apparent. The <a  href="../w/word.html">word</a> seems to be an old name for a kind of <a  href="../d/distilling.html">distilling</a> <a  href="../v/vessel.html">vessel</a>, and occurs only in the arms of the PEWTERERS' Company. In one instance they are blazoned 'cross-bars.'</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, on a chevron or, between three antique limbecks argent, as many roses gules, seeded of the second, barbed, slipped, and leaved proper--The PEWTERERS' Company, London, granted 1479. [Elsewhere the arms of the PEWTERERS' appear to be thus blazoned:--Gules, on a chevron argent between three silver single-handled cups each containing so many sprigs of lilies proper, the Virgin accompanied by four cherubs or enclosed by two pair of limbecks as the second.]</p>
