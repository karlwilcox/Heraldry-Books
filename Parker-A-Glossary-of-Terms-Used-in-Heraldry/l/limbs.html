<h1>Limbs</h1>
<p>Limbs: the Seal of the city of Lichfield(=<a  href="../f/field.html">field</a> of the Lich, or dead body) has a curious representation, in which the disjointed limbs of three men are scattered over the field.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">A landscape, on the dexter side several trees on a hill, on the sinister a view of the cathedral, on the ground the bodies, heads, and limbs of three men all proper[no doubt in allusion to the Lichfield martyrs], with crowns, swords, and banners dispersed all over the field--City of LICHFIELD, co. Stafford.</p>
