<h1>Lyre</h1>
<p>Lyre: this device has been observed but upon one coat of arms, and it would be drawn in the usual classical way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a saltire between four holly leaves vert within a bordure of the last, on a chief azure a lyre between two talbot's heads erased or--BRAHAM, Finchley.</p>
</blockquote>
