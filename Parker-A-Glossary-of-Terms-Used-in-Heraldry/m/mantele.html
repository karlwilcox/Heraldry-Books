<h1>Mantel&eacute;</h1>
<p>Mantel&eacute;, (fr.): while the Chap&eacute; (q.v.) is supposed to obscure, as with a <a  href="../h/hood.html">hood</a>, a part of the shield, so mantel&eacute; is supposed to obscure the same with a <a href="../m/mantle.html">mantle</a>, i.e. a greater part is so obscured: (according to some=<a  href="../p/party.html">party</a> per chevron extending to the top of the escutcheon). Not, however. used in any English arms.</p>
