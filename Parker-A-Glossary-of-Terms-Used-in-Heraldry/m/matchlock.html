<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/403d.png" alt="Matchlock." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Matchlock.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Matchlock: a doubtful figure which has been blazoned <a href="../m/matchlock.html">matchlock</a>, bill-head, ploughshare, and crescent. Probably what was intended by the figure is a rest for the gun when <a  href="../f/fired.html">firing</a> it, and not the gun itself, to which that name is given.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron between three matchlocks sable--LEVERSEGE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a bend engrailed and in chief a matchlock sable--COSANCE, Higham Barrow.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, on a chevron argent, between three matchlocks[pistols] or, as many roses gules barbed vert seeded or--HOPKINS.</p>
