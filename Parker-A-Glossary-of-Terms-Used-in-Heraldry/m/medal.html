<h1>Medal</h1>
<p>Medal: in later coats of arms of very debased heraldry special medals or medallions, clasps, &amp;c., granted for services in war have been frequently adopted. Sometimes a coin is introduced, e.g. a <a  href="../p/pagoda.html">pagoda</a>(i.e. a Madras coin), and in one old instance what is called a <a  href="../p/penny-yard-penny.html">penny-yard penny</a>. This is a coin which is said to have been struck in Penyard Castle, near Ross, Herefordshire.</p>
