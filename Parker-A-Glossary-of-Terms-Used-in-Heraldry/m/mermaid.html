<p>Mermaid, (fr. sir&eacute;ne): composed of the upper half of a woman(with dishevelled hair) joined to the lower half of a fish. It occurs but very seldom as a <a  href="../c/charge.html">charge</a> upon true English arms. The <a  href="../s/siren.html">Siren</a> seems to be only another name for the <a href="../m/mermaid.html">mermaid</a>.</p>
