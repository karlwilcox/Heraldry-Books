<h1>Monastery</h1>
<p>Monastery: a curious device, the following being a unique example, and evidently chosen on account of the name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Per fesse purple and vert; on a fesse sable a monastery with two wings argent; in base three monks, the centre one affronty the other two confronting him habited, all proper--MONKHOUSE, Newcastle-on-Tyne.</p>
</blockquote>
