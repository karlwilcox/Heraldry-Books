<h1>Moon</h1>
<p>Moon, (fr. lune, lat. luna): the moon is a common <a  href="../d/device.html">device</a>. It is occasionally borne full, when it is termed in fer complement, and it is then figured with a human face. It may also be illuminated, that is, surrounded with very short rays. It <a  href="../p/proper.html">proper</a> <a  href="../t/tincture.html">tincture</a> is argent. When <a  href="../s/sable.html">sable</a> it is supposed to be eclipsed.</p>
<a id="414"></a><p class="blazon">When a half moon is represented with the <a  href="../h/horn.html">horns</a> towards the dexter side of the shield it is supposed to be increscent, and is described as in her <a  href="../i/increment.html">increment</a>; when the <a  href="../h/horn.html">horns</a> are turned to the sinister side it is supposed to be decrescent, and is described as in her decrement(or, as some blunderingly write it, in her <a  href="../d/detriment.html">detriment</a>). But these terms are chiefly found in theoretical works, and not often in practical blazon. When the <a  href="../h/horn.html">horns</a> are represented uppermost the charge is simply a Crescent, and this from the earliest times was the special ensign of the Turks.</p>
