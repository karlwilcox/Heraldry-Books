<h1>Mulberry</h1>
<p>Mulberry, (fr. mÃ»re, old fr. moure): the leaves of this plant occur on arms as early as temp. Henry III. as well as in recent arms. One example only of a branch has been noticed on arms, viz. on those of BASSANO(see under Silkworm), but it was used as a <a  href="../d/device.html">device</a> or cognizance by MOWBRAY.</p>
