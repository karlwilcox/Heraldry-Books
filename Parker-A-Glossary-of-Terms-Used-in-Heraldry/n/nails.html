<p>Nails are of various kinds; the <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">ordinary</a> <a href="../n/nails.html">nail</a> has a square head; those in insignia of the GLAZIERS' Company are called <a  href="../c/close.html">closing</a> <a href="../n/nails.html">nails</a>, and are drawn as in the margin; tilers' <a href="../n/nails.html">nails</a> have larger heads than ordinary <a href="../n/nails.html">nails</a>. Horse-nails are also found named. The term <a  href="../s/spike.html">spike</a> is sometimes used for <a href="../n/nails.html">nail</a>, and the drawing is sometimes mistaken for the <a  href="../w/wedge.html">wedge</a>. (See also <a  href="../p/passion-nail.html">Passion-nails</a>).</p>
