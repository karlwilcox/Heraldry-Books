<p>Nebuly, (fr. nebul&eacute;): an undulating line of division, which being intended to represent clouds is drawn horizontally; when applied to the <a  href="../f/field.html">field</a>, however, it is usually described as <a  href="../b/barry.html">barry</a> <a href="../n/nebuly.html">nebuly</a>, q.v. But it may also be applied to <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">ordinaries</a> such as the <a  href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a> and chevron; but not to an ordinary so as to interfere with its horizontal position. It is liable to be confused from careless drawing with <a  href="../u/undy.html">undy</a> or wavy, and in ancient armoury with <a  href="../v/vair.html">vair</a>; but though the term does not occur in early blazon, it was in later blazon no doubt intended to denote a different form from either.</p>
