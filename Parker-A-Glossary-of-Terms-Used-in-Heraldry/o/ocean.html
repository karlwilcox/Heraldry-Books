<h1>Ocean</h1>
<p>Ocean: the waves of the ocean, or sea, are occasionally painted on the base of the shield in modern heraldry, but can scarcely be considered as an heraldic charge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, the sun in splendour or; in base the ocean proper; on a canton argent an escutcheon gules charged with a lion passant gardant of the second--ROYAL INSTITUTION OF GREAT BRITAIN, established 1800.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, on the waves of the sea proper a lion passant or; in chief three bezants--HAWKINS, co. Dorset.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a bend sinister or; in base the end and stock of an anchor gold issuant from waves of the sea proper; in chief two estoiles in like bend as the second--SHIFFNER, co. Sussex, 1818.</p>
