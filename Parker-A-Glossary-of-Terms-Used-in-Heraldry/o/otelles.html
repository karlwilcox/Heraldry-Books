<h1>Otelles</h1>
<a id="432"><p>Otelles, (fr.): a term used by some French heralds for four figures described as resembling four peeled almonds, the thickened portion meeting in the centre, something after the fashion of the filberts in the Cross avellane,  &sect;12, but in saltire instead of in cross, and the ends pointed instead of fleury.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">De gueules, a quatre otelles d'argent adoss&eacute;s en sautoir--COMMINGES, Guienne and Gascoigne.</p>
