<h1>Otter</h1>
<p>Otter, (fr. loutre): this animal was more frequent in streams than now, and otter-hunting was once a favourite pastime. The stream near Hexham was called the Otterbourne, from which the family mentioned below derive their name. Otters are borne in the arms of several families. The two otters borne as <a  href="../s/supporters.html">supporters</a> to the <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of NORREYS are represented <a  href="../c/collared.html">collared</a> and chained, each devouring a fish, as may be seen in the stained glass at Ockwells in Berkshire. As supporters to the arms of the SALTERS' Company they are represented <a  href="../s/sable.html">sable</a> bazanty, ducally collared and chained, each devouring a fish. Two otters rampant proper are the supporters to the arms of BALFOUR of Orkney, and of KINLOCH. The family of LUTTRELL bear otters in allusion to the French name; possibly by the sea dogs(q.v.) otters are intended.</p>
