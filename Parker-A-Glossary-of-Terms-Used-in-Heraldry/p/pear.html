<h1>Pear</h1>
<p>Pear, (fr. poire): this, like other fruits, may be <a href="../p/pendent.html">pendent</a>, <a  href="../e/erect.html">erected</a>, or barwise. The kind called the Warden-pear is borne by the family of WARDEN, of WARDON Priory, Bedfordshire; but it is not to be distinguished in the drawing from any other species of pear. The Pear-tree(fr. poirier) is also found.</p>
