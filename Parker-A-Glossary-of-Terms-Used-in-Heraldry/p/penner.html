<p>Penner and Ink-horn: that the materials for writing should find a place in heraldic devices is not extraordinary. The most marked example is the penner as exhibited in the insignia of the SCRIVENERS' Company. The <a  href="../s/sandbox.html">Sand-box</a> is also found in one coat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, an eagle displayed holding in the beak a penner and inkhorn, standing on a book fesswise closed, the clasps downwards or--Company of SCRIVENERS, London, [Inc. 1616].</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a chevron between three writing sand-boxes reversed issuing sand or--SANDON, Horton.</p>
