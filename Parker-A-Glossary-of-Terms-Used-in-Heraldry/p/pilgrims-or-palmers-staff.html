<h1>Pilgrim's or Palmer's Staff</h1>
<p>Pilgrim's or Palmer's Staff, (fr. bourdon): this was used as a <a  href="../d/device.html">device</a> in a coat of arms as early at least as Edward II.'s reign, as will be seen. The <a  href="../s/staff.html">Staff</a> and the Escallop shell(q.v.) were the badge of the pilgrim, and hence it is but natural it should find its way into the shields of those who had visited the Holy Land. The usual form of representation is like figure 1, but is some the hook is wanting, and when this is the case it is scarcely distinguishable from a pastoral staff as borne by some of the monasteries: it is shewn in figure 2. While, too, it is represented under different forms, it is blazoned as will be seen also, under different names, e.g. a pilgrim's <a  href="../c/crutch.html">crutch</a>, a crutch-staff, &amp;c., but there is no reason to suppose that the different names can be correlated with different figures. The <a  href="../c/crutch.html">crutch</a>, perhaps, should be represented with the transverse piece on the top of the staff(like the <a  href="../l/letters.html">letter</a> <b>T</b>) instead of across it. See <a href="../p/potent.html">Potent</a>, also <a  href="../s/staff.html">Staff</a>.</p>
