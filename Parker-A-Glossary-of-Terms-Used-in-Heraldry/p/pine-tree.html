<h1>Pine-tree</h1>
<p>Pine-tree, (fr. pin): this tree occurs in some few coats of arms, and more frequently the Pine-apple(fr. pomme de pin), or rather the <a  href="../c/cone.html">cone</a> of the <a href="../p/pine-tree.html">pine-tree</a>. In some modern instances the fruit of the tree is represented, but then the term <a  href="../a/ananas.html">ananas</a> ought to be employed to prevent confusion.</p>
