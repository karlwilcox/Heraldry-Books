<p>Plumbers' implements consist of five or six kinds. There is first of all the cutting-knife; next the shave-hook; next the soldering-irons; and next the cross staff. These are shewn in the margin as they are usually represented in the insignia of the PLUMBERS' Company. The <a  href="../l/levels.html">level</a> and the plummet form the same <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> have already been figured under <a  href="../l/levels.html">level</a>. The <a  href="../s/soldering-iron.html">soldering-irons</a>, it will be seen, were borne by two branches of the family of SHRIGLEY(unless the variation in the blazon arises from error), as well as by the family of BIDDULPH.</p>
