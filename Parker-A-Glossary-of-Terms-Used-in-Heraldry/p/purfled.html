<h1>Purfled</h1>
<p>Purfled, or Purflewed: <a  href="../g/garnished.html">garnished</a>: a term applied to the studs and ornaments of armour, the trimmings of robes, arrows, birdbolts, (q.v.) Some call a border of ermine, or any other fur, a bordure purflew ermine, &amp;c., but this is needless, and indeed unintelligible.</p>
