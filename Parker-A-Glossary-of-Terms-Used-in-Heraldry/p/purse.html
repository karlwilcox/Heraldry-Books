<p>Purse, (fr. bourse), stringed and tasselled, is represented as in the margin. The <a href="../p/purse.html">purse</a> of state, in which the great seal is kept, is of similar form, but more richly adorned. Very similar to the purse is the pouch or scrip. See under Pilgrim's <a  href="../s/staff.html">Staff</a>.</p>
