<p>Rest: this is puzzling device, but the more probable interpretation is that it represents a spear rest, though possibly in one or two cases a horn from had drawing, has been mistaken for it. The <a  href="../d/device.html">device</a> is called by Leigh and others Sufflue, and by Guillim Clarion, though he hints that it may be a <a href="../r/rudder.html">rudder</a>. Gibbon proposes the term <a  href="../o/organ-rest.html">Organ-rest</a>, but mentions a MS. wherein it is called Claricimbal, or Clavecimbal. Morgan terms it a Clarendon, obviously a mistake for Clarion. It is otherwise called a Clavicord. Rest, however, is the term generally used for the <a  href="../d/device.html">device</a>.</p>
