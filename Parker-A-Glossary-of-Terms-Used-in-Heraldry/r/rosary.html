<h1>Rosary</h1>
<p>Rosary: the chain of beads so called seems to occur but in two coats of arms. See BEADNELL under <a  href="../g/garter.html">Garter</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Vert, eleven round beads in chevron, surmounted in the centre by a cross; pendent to the two end beads a tassel, all or, between three cinquefoils argent--WIMBUSH.</p>
</blockquote>
