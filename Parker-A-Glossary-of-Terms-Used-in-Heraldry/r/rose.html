<h1>Rose</h1>
<p>Rose, (fr. rose): this flower is very frequently employed in coats of arms, and more frequently still in badges. In the very ancient rolls, however, it is chiefly borne by <a  href="../b/branch.html">branches</a> of the one family of the D'ARCYS. The <a  href="../f/flowers.html">flower</a> is not to be drawn with a stalk unless blazoned <a  href="../s/stalked.html">stalked</a>, or <a  href="../s/slipped.html">slipped</a>. The heraldic rose should consist of five foils as drawn in the example; though examples are to be found with six foils, and perhaps with four. The <a  href="../w/word.html">word</a> <a  href="../p/proper.html">proper</a> applied to the barbs(of five leaves of the calyx) and central seeds, implies that the former are green, and the latter gold or yellow. A <a href="../r/rose.html">rose</a> is the difference of the seventh house. Sometimes <a href="../r/rose.html">roses</a> are arranged in a chaplet, q.v. and they are sometimes <a  href="../c/crown.html">crowned</a>.</p>

<p class="blazon">A double rose also occurs, that is one within another, and they are thus conjoined, either by placing a white rose upon a red one, or a red one upon a white. The term rosette is employed in one case where there are several.</p>

<p class="blazon">It will be seen also that rose branches, slips, and leaves are occasionally borne separately; and one early instance has been bserved in which the phrase '3 rosers' occurs.</p>

<p class="blazon">The use of the Rose as a political emblem may be <a  href="../t/trace.html">traced</a> to the wars between the rival Houses of York and Lancaster, the former of which used the <a  href="../d/device.html">device</a> of a <a  href="../w/white.html">white</a> <a href="../r/rose.html">rose</a>, while a red one was the badge of the other, and these came to be blazoned occasionally as the <a href="../r/rose.html">Rose</a> of York and Lancaster respectively. They are said to have been first assumed by John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and his brother Edmund, Duke of York. Both these roses were sometimes surrounded with <a href="../r/ray.html">rays</a>, and termed en soleil, and later on they were frequently conjoined.</p>
