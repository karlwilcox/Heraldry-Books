<p>Rudder: this device occurs but in few arms. The usual position seems to be with the <a  href="../h/hook.html">hooks</a> to the <a  href="../d/dexter.html">dexter</a>, but they are sometimes drawn turned the other way, and should be so noticed in the blazon. Guillim suggests that the crest(q.v.) was intended for a rudder.</p>
