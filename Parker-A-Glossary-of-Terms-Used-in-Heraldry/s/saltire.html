<p>Saltire, or saltier, (fr. sautoir): this honourable ordinary is supposed to represent the cross whereon S.Andrew was crucified, and the standard or banner of S.Andrew is one bearing the saltire argent on a field azure.</p>
<a id="516"></a><p class="blazon">The <a  href="../p/plain.html">plain</a> <a href="../s/saltire.html">saltire</a> is nothing but a cross placed in a different position, and whatever was the origin of the one as a <a  href="../d/device.html">device</a> upon a shield, was probably also the origin of the other. Almost all the forms incident to the cross are likewise applicable to the saltire. They may be <a  href="../h/humetty.html">humetty</a>, and in a French example to which the term <a  href="../e/engoule.html">engoul&eacute;</a> is applied, the arms of the cross are terminated by Leopards' <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a>, their mouths holding the ends.</p>
<p class="blazon">As will be observed, the 'sautoir' occurs in the ancient rolls, and it may be added that in one roll temp. ED. II., out of twenty-eight examples of the saltire only ten are plain and eighteen are engrailed.</p>

<a id="517"></a><p class="blazon">As to the expression a saltire lozengy, as has ben said respecting the Cross Lozengy(see  &sect;8), there seems to have ben great carelessness in the blazon by the heralds of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It should be described where there is one tincture, a saltire of so many lozenges, &amp;c. The first example of the following is clear; the others leave it obscure as to what is meant, and how the lozenges, &amp;c., should be arranged.</p>

<p class="blazon">Saltirewise, and in saltire, (fr. pass&eacute; en sautoir), are words used to describe the position of charges placed in the form of that ordinary. The former is properly applied to two long charges, as <a href="../s/sword.html">swords</a>, q.v., fishes, &amp;c., when <a  href="../c/crossed.html">crossing</a> each other bendwise, and the latter to five charges, placed 2, 1, 2; but, as will be observed, the terms are practically interchangeable, the latter, however, being more frequently used.</p>
<p class="blazon">With reference to the former, it is necessary to state that the sword in bend dexter should be uppermost unless otherwise directed, because the dexter side, and consequently any thing placed in bend dexter, in more honourable than the sinister, though the distinction is but little attended to in practice. See examples under <a  href="../k/keys.html">Keys</a>, <a  href="../m/mace.html">Mace</a>, <a href="../s/scythe.html">Scythe</a>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="blazon">The term saltorel is sometimes used when three or more saltires occur, but it us hardly required. It is needless to say that must be couped; but it should be noted that the ends are not cut at right angles to the arms, but horizontally, and when the saltorel is engrailed the ends are left plain.</p>
