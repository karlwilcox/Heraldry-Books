p>Scotland, Insignia of: the heraldic insignia of this ancient kingdom are mythically said to have been assumed by FERGUS I., who is supposed to have reigned from A.D. 403 to 419, viz.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Or, a lion rampant gules--SCOTLAND.</p>
</blockquote>
The <a  href="../l/lion.html">lion</a> first appears distinctly upon the seal of Alexander II., 1214-49, but whence derived, or whether then first assumed, it is impossible to say. Afterwards the Lion was surrounded by a double tressure.<br>
<p class="blazon">The parliament of James III. in 1471, "ordanit that in tyme to cum thar suld be na double trezor about his armys, bot that he suld ber hale armys of the lyoun, without ony mur." Notwithstanding this enactment, the double tressure is still a prominent part of the arms of Scotland.</p>

<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> are now blazoned as follows:--</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Or, a lion rampant within a double tressure, flory counterflory gules.</p>
<p class="blazon">The Crest[Upon an imperial crown proper.] A lion sejant affront&eacute; gules, imperially crowned or, holding in his dexter paw a sceptre, and in his sinister a sword[both proper].</p>
<p class="blazon">Supporters. Two unicorns argent, gorged with a royal coronet and chained or.</p>

<p class="blazon">The double tressure is sometimes referred to as the <a  href="../b/bordure.html">Bordure</a> of <a href="../s/scotland.html">Scotland</a>.</p>
