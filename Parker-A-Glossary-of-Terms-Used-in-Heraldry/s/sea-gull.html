<h1>Sea-Gull</h1>
<p>Sea-Gull, (lat. larus): to the family of Gulls(larid&oelig;Â“) belong the sea-gulls and sea-mews, as well as the <a  href="../t/tern.html">terns</a>, all of which are found in coats of arms. Probably the general term sea-fowl, and the name <a href="../s/sea-pewit.html">sea-pewit</a>(perhaps given to the <a  href="../g/gull.html">gull</a> from its manner of flight), both of which occur, should be referred to the common <a href="../s/sea-gull.html">sea-gull</a>.</p>
