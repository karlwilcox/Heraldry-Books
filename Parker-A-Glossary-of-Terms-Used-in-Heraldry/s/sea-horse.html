<h1>Sea-horse</h1>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/523b.png" alt="Sea-horse." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Sea-horse.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Sea-horse: this monstrosity is in heraldic drawing represented by the upper part, i.e. <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a> and fore-legs of a horse joined to the tail of a fish, which is twisted back, as shewn in the illustration; at the same time when correctly drawn the legs terminate in slightly webbed feet instead of in hoofs. Further a scalloped fin is substituted for the mane, and is continued down the back. Besides appearing as <a href="../s/supporters.html">supporters</a> to the insignia of the towns of Cambridge and of Ipswich, sea-horses appear in the following coats of arms.</p>

<p>Similar to this is the sea-lion(or as it is sometimes called from the French lion poisson). is which the upper part is that of a lion, the lower that of the body and tail of a fish. The mane is sometimes also represented <a  href="../c/crested.html">crested</a> or escalloped. Besides occurring as as the <a href="../s/supporters.html">supporters</a> of the <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of <a  href="../v/viscount.html">Viscount</a> FALMOUTH, it appears in the following coats of arms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a sea-lion couchant azure, crowned, armed and langued gules--SILVESTER.</p>
<a id="525"></a><p class="blazon">Azure, a bridge of three arches embattled at top in fesse argent, masoned sable, between three sea-lions passant or--BRIDGEN, Lord Mayor of London, 1764.</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, on a bend wavy between two sea-lions sable three buck's heads caboshed argent--Sir Robert HARLAND, Bart., Orwell Park, Suffolk. [A sea-lion supporting an anchor, crest of the same.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sea-dragon is also to be classed amongst monstrosities, though it has been suggested it is intended for the conger-eel, and thus the heads in the insignia of KING'S LYNN have been blazoned 'dragon's <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a>.' Again, when the term occurs in the blazon of the crest of Sir Jacob GERRARD, Bart., 1662, it is said to be a wyvern.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Per chevron gules and or; three sea-dragons ducally crowned counterchanged--EASTON, co. Devon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sea-dog is still more uncertain. It has been suggested that the device is intended for a crocodile, but this results only from had drawing. With better reason it is suggested to be a fanciful representation of the otter: but like all monstrosities the origin must be looked for in the imagination of the draughtsman rather than in the realm of nature. It is drawn like a <a  href="../t/talbot.html">talbot</a>, with the whole body scaled, and the tail of a beaver. The feet are webbed and the back scalloped like that of a sea-horse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three demi dea-dogs passant in pale sable--JESSE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Per fesse nebuly ... and ... three sea-dogs passant counterchanged--HARRIS, Cornwall.</p>
<p class="blazon">[Baron STOURTON has two such animals, sable, scaled or, for his supporters.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The sea-wolf also belongs to the same category, and this has been supported only to be the seal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron engrailed gules between three marine wolves(or sea-dogs) naiant sable finned, ventred, and dented of the first, langued of the second--FENNOR, Sussex; granted 10 November, 1557.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be added that the French treat several land animals in this manner by adding the tails of fish to them, and they have a special term to signify the same, viz. marin&eacute;.</p>
