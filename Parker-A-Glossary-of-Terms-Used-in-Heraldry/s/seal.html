<p>Seal: this marine mammal has adopted in some few coats of arms. It seems to have been fancifully called by some heraldic writers the sea-calf, and sea-wolf; possibly, too, by the sea-bear in meant the seal(see under <a  href="../b/bear.html">Bear</a>). The whole animal, however, does not appear to be represented; only the paws and the head, and then but rarely.</p>
