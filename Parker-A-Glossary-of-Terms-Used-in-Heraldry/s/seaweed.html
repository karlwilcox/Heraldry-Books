<h1>Seaweed</h1>
<p>Seaweed: the laver occurs in the insignia of the town of Liverpool, (in allusion to the name). The same <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> were borne also as an <a  href="../a/augmentations.html">augmentation</a> by the <a  href="../e/earl.html">Earl</a> of Liverpool, created Earl in 1796. In a French example feuille de varech, i.e. of wrack, has been observed in one blazon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a[lever or] cormorant sable beaked and legged gules, holding in the beak a branch of seaweed called laver inverted vert[originally the eagle of S.John holding a penner and inkhorn]--City of LIVERPOOL.</p>
<p class="blazon">D'argent, a une feuille de varech de gueules accost&eacute;e de deux crois sants d'azure--BEUARD, Normandie.</p>
