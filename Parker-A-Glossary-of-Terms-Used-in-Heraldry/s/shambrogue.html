<h1>Shambrogue</h1>
<p>Shambrogue, or Shambrough, is defined by Berry and other heraldic writers as a kind of <a href="../s/ship.html">ship</a>; but it is more probably a kind of <a  href="../b/boot.html">boot</a>, (cf. Irish brogue under <a  href="../b/boot.html">boot</a>).</p>
<blockquote>

<p class="blazon">Or, on a bend sable, three shambroughs argent[otherwise Or, on a bend sable three legs in armour couped at the thigh, and erased at the ankle proper]--BLAGRAVE.</p>
