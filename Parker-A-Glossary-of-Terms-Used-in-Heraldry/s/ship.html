<h1>Ship</h1>
<p>Ship, (fr. navire or vaisseau): this is a very frequent device, and especially in the insignia of sea-port towns and merchant companies. The form varies greatly in different examples, being for the most part copied from the existing fashion. When <a href="../s/ship.html">ships</a> are named they should be most scrupulously blazoned, care being especially taken to state the number of masts and top-masts, whether there are any sails(fr. voiles), and if any, whether they are furled or not. The <a  href="../r/rigging.html">rigging</a>, too, it will be seen is often of a different tincture. It will be noted that the hulk of the vessel is often named, and sometimes the <a href="../s/stern.html">stern</a>. Ship and Castles are so exceedingly varied in form that they present greater difficulties than almost any other bearings.</p>

<p class="blazon">It will be found that a ship proper is generally represented with three masts; if with one mast it is perhaps better blazoned as a <a  href="../l/lymphad.html">Lymphad</a>(q.v.), (which may have oars as well), or a galley, though the latter may have three masts.</p>

<p class="blazon">With the French when the <a  href="../m/mast.html">masts</a> are of a different tincture the term equip&eacute; is used, and when the <a href="../s/sail.html">sails</a> are so, habill&eacute;.</p>

<p class="blazon">The hull or hulk of the vessel is sometimes <a  href="../f/figured.html">figured</a> separately on arms, and in a few cases(the insignia of the CINQUE PORTS being the characteristic examples), a portion only of the hull is shewn. Often, too, the hulk is conjoined to some other charge. The <a href="../s/sail.html">sails</a> and the masts are also as <a  href="../d/device.html">devices</a>; the former is sometimes drawn with a portion of the mast, of at least of the yardarm.</p>

<p class="blazon">The term <a  href="../a/antique.html">antique</a> or ancient ship sometimes means the <a  href="../l/lymphad.html">Lymphad</a>, q.v. When <a  href="../o/oar.html">oars</a> are named(a in the arms SINCLAIR), though the charge is called a <a href="../s/ship.html">ship</a>, it is meant probably far a galley. A Spanish merchant-ship occurs in the arms of FAVENC(see under <a  href="../m/mulberry.html">Mulberry</a>), and the Noah's <a  href="../a/ark.html">ark</a>, borne by the Company of SHIPWRIGHTS, has been mentioned in its proper place. The <a href="../s/shambrogue.html">shambrogue</a>(q.v.), which writers refer to as a <a href="../s/ship.html">ship</a>, seems not to be a ship at all.</p>
<blockquote>
