<p>Sling: the ancient means for hurling missiles against the enemy(called also a swepe) occurs in one or two coats of arms, though not in any ancient ones, so far as has been observed. The <a href="../s/sling.html">sling</a>, or staff-sling, is represented as in the margin.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a href="../s/sweep.html">sweep</a>(more correctly spelt swepe) is used as if synonymous. It is, however, the same as the <a  href="../b/balista.html">balista</a>, and is so blazoned in one coat; it is a more formidable engine of warfare, similar to the catapult or mangonel, whence in one case the play on the name.</p>
