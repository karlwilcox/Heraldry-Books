<h1>Sparrow</h1>
<p>Sparrow: the common <a href="../s/sparrow.html">sparrow</a> has been chosen for the sake of the name of one family, and in imperfect blazon may be noted as regards another family, the name <a  href="../p/phillip.html">Phillip</a> being sometimes applied to a tame sparrow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, six sparrows, three, two and one sable; on a chief indented gules, two swords in saltire between as many wolf's heads erased or--SPAROW, London; granted 1516.</p>
<p class="blazon">... three sparrows ... --PHILLIP, Brignell, co. York.</p>
