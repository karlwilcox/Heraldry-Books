<h1>Spear</h1>
<p>Spear: it might have been expected that this charge would have been found in ancient arms, but so far as has been observed it is not the case. It is, however, not unfrequent in later arms. The <a  href="../t/tilting-spear.html">tilting-spear</a> <a  href="../p/proper.html">proper</a> should have the vamplet shewn, i.e. the funnel-shaped projection near where the hand holds it. The <a  href="../c/cronel.html">cronel</a> also belonging to the tilting-spear has been already mentioned.</p>
<a id="545"></a><p class="blazon">With the <a href="../s/spear.html">spear</a> must be included the lance(fr. lance), dart, or javelin(fr. javelot). (See <a  href="../p/pheon.html">Pheon</a>). It is different to distinguish them, but the lance is much longer than the dart or javelin, and the head is not barbed. The <a  href="../d/dart.html">dart</a> may, perhaps, be represented as a <a  href="../l/long.html">long</a> <a  href="../a/arrow.html">arrow</a>(q.v.), and like the <a  href="../j/javelin.html">javelin</a> should have a barbed head. A broken spear(fr. eclart&eacute;) signifies the lower half, the upper having been broken off. Spears may be represented in parcels. A half spear signifies the upper half of the spear.</p>
