<h1>Staff</h1>
<p>Staff: the term is usually qualified by some word expressing its special purpose or character, such as Pilgrim's or Palmer's <a href="../s/staff.html">staff</a>, q.v.; <a  href="../p/pike-staff.html">pike-staff</a>, generally drawn like the first figure of the pilgrim's <a href="../s/staff.html">staff</a>, but without the <a  href="../h/hook.html">hook</a>; flag-staff; <a  href="../q/quarter-staff.html">quarter-staff</a>, used by foresters, &amp;c.; <a  href="../c/cross/staff.html">Cross-staff</a>, q.v., and pastoral-staff, see under <a  href="../c/crosier.html">Crosier</a>. Sometimes the kind of <a href="../s/staff.html">staff</a> is implied, as a <a  href="../b/banner.html">Banner</a> and staff(see under <a  href="../p/paschal-lamb.html">Paschal Lamb</a>); a crozier with the <a href="../s/staff.html">staff</a> of such a tincture, &amp;c.</p>
<blockquote>

<p class="blazon">The <a href="../s/staff.html">staff</a> <a  href="../r/raguly.html">raguly</a>, or <a  href="../r/ragged-staff.html">ragged-staff</a>, occurs very frequently, and the term implies a branch of a tree, with the <a  href="../t/twig.html">twigs</a> <a  href="../l/lopped.html">lopped</a>, and resembling a <a  href="../c/club.html">club</a>. It is generally drawn couped, and then the term <a  href="../t/trunked.html">trunked</a> is used; when <a  href="../t/throughout.html">throughout</a> the better blazon would be a <a  href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a> or bend raguly. It will be observed that it is sometimes represented flammant, but perhaps in that case a fire-brand raguly would be the better blazon.</p>
