<h1>Stones</h1>
<p>Stones. These are very seldom found separately. Two remarkable cases of cranes holding a stone by their feet are given under <a  href="../c/crane.html">Crane</a>. The <a href="../s/stones.html">stones</a> in walls are represented by <a  href="../m/masoned.html">Masoning</a>. They flag-stones are found in the insignia of the PAVIOURS' Company; and a marble-stone will be found in the singular coat of arms given under <a href="../s/sengreen.html">Sengreen</a>. Tombstones and Millstones will be found under their several headings; while the Star-stone is only another name for a <a href="../s/shot.html">Shot</a>(q.v.) of a particular sort, and gun-stone for Pellet(q.v.). Also used with a <a  href="../b/balista.html">balista</a>. See <a href="../s/sling.html">Sling</a>. As regards the flint-stone, it is supposed by some to mean a <a href="../s/shot.html">shot</a>, but most probably it is simply a flint which is intended.</p>
