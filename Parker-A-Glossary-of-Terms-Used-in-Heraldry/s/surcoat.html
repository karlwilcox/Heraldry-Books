<h1>Surcoat</h1>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/560a.png" alt="Sir Richard(?) TURVILLE." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Sir Richard(?) TURVILLE.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Surcoat: a coat embroidered with the <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of the wearer, or in the case of heralds, &amp;c., those of his lord. It was at first without <a href="../s/sleeve.html">sleeves</a> and girt with a <a  href="../b/belt.html">belt</a>, but in later times sleeves were added and the belt laid aside. The first English king on whose seal a surcoat appears is King John.</p>
<p class="blazon">The usual practice was for the arms, whether single or quartered, to appear upon the surcoat both before and behind, and also upon each of the sleeves.</p>
<p class="blazon">The figure given is that of one of the TURVILLE family, from glass in Wolston Church, Warwickshire, the arms(upon the surcoat and emerasses) being.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a chevron vair, between three mullets pierced argent--TURVILLE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="blazon">The other figure represents John TALBOT, Earl of Shrewsbury, temp. Hen. VI., and is taken from an ancient painting at Castle Ashby.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The quarters seen upon the body of the surcoat are, Argent, a bend between six martlets--FURNIVALL: and checquy or and azure, a chevron ermine-arms of the ancient Earls of WARWICK. On the sleeve, Gules, a lion rampant with a bordure engrailed or--TALBOT: Azure, a lion rampant with a bordure or--DE BELESME: Gules, a fesse between six cross-crosslets or--BEAUCHAMP: Argent, two lions passant gules--STRANGE of Blackmere: together with FURNIVALL, and WARWICK as before.</p>
</blockquote>
<a id="561"></a><p class="blazon">Ladies formerly wore the arms of their husbands upon their mantles, and their own upon their close-fitting vests. Eleanor, Countess of Arundel, who died 1372, is thus depicted in the east window of Arundel church, Sussex. At a later period the arms were borne impaled on the outer garment; e.g. Elizabeth, wife of John SHELLEY, Esq., on a brass at Clapham, Sussex, 1513.</p>
