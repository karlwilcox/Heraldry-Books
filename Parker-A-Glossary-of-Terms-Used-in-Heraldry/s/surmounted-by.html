<p>Surmounted by: a term used when a bearing is placed over another of a different tincture. In cases where more than one ordinary or charge is surmounted by another, the term <a  href="../o/over-all.html">Over all</a>, q.v., must be used. It is needful to mark the distinction between surmounted and charged, which will appear from the arms of DYXTON. If the pile had been charged with the <a  href="../c/chevron.html">chevron</a>, the latter would not have extended beyond the bounds of the former. The term may also be rightly used of two charges placed in saltire to denote the uppermost one. (See under <a  href="../m/mace.html">Mace</a>, <a href="../s/scythe.html">Scythe</a>, &amp;c.) Debruised, q.v., has also a similar meaning to surmounted, and is frequently used, as also the terms depressed and oppressed.</p>

<a id="562"></a><p class="blazon">The above being the correct signification of the term it must not be overlooked that it is sometimes used irregularly for describing one charge above, i.e. in chief of, another, and this is especially the case in modern French heraldry, when surmont&eacute; or somm&eacute; de is very frequently, if not always, used with this signification. The terms <a  href="../b/brochant.html">brochant</a>(or <a  href="../b/brochant.html">bronchant</a>) sur le tour are more usually employed by French heralds for the true signification of surmounted by. (See <a  href="../o/over-all.html">Over all</a>.)</p>
