<h1>Tombstone</h1>
<p>Tombstone: the seat of Prester-John(q.v.) in the insignia of the See of CHICHESTER, and of S.Mary in those of the See of LINCOLN(see <a  href="../n/nimbus.html">Nimbus</a>), is so called, though in neither case is it at all probable that the bearing is intended for such. The <a href="../t/tombstone.html">Tombstone</a>, sometimes called an Alter, or which the <a  href="../h/holy-lamb.html">Holy Lamb</a> stands, in the Arms of the College of ASHRIDGE is probably a Tomb, the device signifying the Resurrection. Other examples occasionally occur, e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a tombstone gules--ALBON.</p>
<p class="blazon">Vert, three tombstones argent--TOMBS[represented as coped stones crossed].</p>
</blockquote>
