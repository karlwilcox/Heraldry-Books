<h1>Tower</h1>
<p>Tower, (fr. tour): towers and turrets are more frequently named in connection with the <a  href="../c/castle.html">Castle</a>(q.v.), but they are also found in some cases as distinct charges. Though a castle is sometimes represented as consisting of a single tower, it generally has at least three. The <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">ordinary</a> <a href="../t/tower.html">tower</a> is drawn as the first example given in the margin.</p>

<p class="blazon">But the tower is also frequently represented as bearing three smaller towers or turrets, and then it is blazoned <a href="../t/triple-towered.html">triple towered</a>, or triple turretted: in that case it is drawn as the annexed figure in the margin, sometimes with the <a href="../t/turret.html">turrets</a> slightly sloping outwards, sometimes <a  href="../u/upright.html">upright</a>. It is frequently described as having a dome or cupola, both terms being used for the same thing; and sometimes a <a  href="../s/spire.html">spire</a> or conical roof. Also as provided with a <a  href="../p/port.html">port</a> or entrance, port-holes or windows, battlements, &amp;c.</p>
