<h1>Tree</h1>
<p>Tree, (fr. arbre): the tree is a very common bearing in later heraldry, but is very rare, if used at all, in early arms. In the <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of Sir Rauf de CHEYNDUT the cheyne probably means only the acorn, as in the arms of MORIENS the leaves only of the mulberry-tree are intended. But in later arms several examples will be found, both of <a href="../t/tree.html">trees</a> generally and special kinds of <a href="../t/tree.html">trees</a> and shrubs(fr. arbustes). Amongst these are found the <a  href="../o/oak.html">oak</a>(fr. ch&ecirc;ne), (the most frequent); <a  href="../a/apple.html">apple</a>(fr. pommier); <a  href="../o/orange.html">orange</a>(fr. oranger); fig(fr. figuier); <a  href="../a/ash.html">ash</a>(fr. fr&ecirc;ne); elm(fr. orme and ormeau); <a  href="../h/hawthorn.html">hawthorn</a>(fr. aub&eacute;pin); <a  href="../h/holly.html">holly</a>(fr. <a  href="../h/houx.html">houx</a>); <a  href="../l/laurel.html">laurel</a>(fr. <a  href="../l/laurier.html">laurier</a>); maple; <a  href="../p/palm.html">palm</a>(fr. palmier); pine(fr. pin); fir(fr. sapin); <a  href="../c/cedar.html">cedar</a>; <a  href="../c/cypress.html">cypress</a>(fr. cypr&egrave;s); poplar(fr. peuplier); willow(fr. saule); and yew. Also the <a  href="../l/leaves.html">leaves</a> and branches of several other trees, e.g. <a  href="../b/beech.html">beech</a>(fr. h&ecirc;tre); <a  href="../m/mulberry.html">mulberry</a>(fr. murier); olive(fr. olivier); <a  href="../w/walnut.html">walnut</a>(fr. noyer); <a  href="../n/nut.html">nut</a>(fr. noisetier). (See Synopsis.)</p>
<p class="blazon">In French arms, besides those noted above, have been observed, baume(balsam); buis(box); cormier(service-tree); <a  href="../c/chataignier.html">ch&acirc;tagnier</a>(chestnut); aubier(sap-wood); <a  href="../g/gui.html">gui</a>(mistletoe); neflier(medlar); but no English examples of these have been observed.</p>

<a id="582"></a><p class="blazon">When the term <a href="../t/tree.html">tree</a> only is named without any adjunct, it may be considered to be that of the oak, and may be drawn like the example given under that term. But more frequently it is subjected to some special treatment, e.g. it may have the appearance of being torn up by the roots, to which the term <a  href="../e/eradicated.html">eradicated</a>(fr. <a  href="../a/arrache.html">arrach&eacute;</a>) is applied(and this is a better term than erased, which should only be applied to parts of animals). The <a href="../t/tree.html">tree</a> is often trunked, i.e. <a href="../t/truncated.html">truncated</a>(fr. <a  href="../e/etete.html">&eacute;t&ecirc;t&eacute;</a>), pollard(fr. &eacute;cim&eacute;), or lopped(fr. &eacute;cot&eacute;); or it may be <a  href="../c/couped.html">couped</a>, so that the section is seen in perspective, and in that case the term <a  href="../s/snagged.html">snagged</a> should be applied. Again it may be withered(fr. sec); or it may be broken, or blasted, or without <a  href="../b/branch.html">branches</a>(fr. <a  href="../e/ebranche.html">&eacute;branch&eacute;</a>). A full-grown tree is said to be accrued. A <a href="../t/tree.html">tree</a> may be <a  href="../f/fructed.html">fructed</a>(fr. fruit&eacute;), and this applied to the <a  href="../o/oak.html">oak</a>(q.v.) would signify with <a  href="../a/acorn.html">acorns</a>(fr. <a  href="../e/englante.html">englant&eacute;</a>). When the <a href="../t/trunk.html">trunk</a> is a different tincture from the rest of the tree the French use the term <a  href="../f/fute.html">fÃ»t&eacute;</a>.</p>

<p class="blazon">But besides the <a href="../t/tree.html">trees</a> themselves, parts of trees are frequently borne. We find the <a href="../t/trunk.html">trunk</a>(fr. tronc d'arbre), stock, stem, stump(fr. souche), or body, the terms appearing to be used indiscriminately by heralds, but meaning the same thing; these are generally <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as <a  href="../c/couped.html">couped</a>, and if not it is implied; they are also frequently eradicated, and it should be stated when they have branches(as in the arms of BOROUGH above) or slips, as in the arms of STOCKDEN below.</p>
<p class="blazon">We find also the term <a  href="../l/limb.html">limb</a> used, and this is generally represented <a  href="../r/raguly.html">raguly</a>(similar to which, perhaps, is the fr. noueux). It should be drawn so as to give the appearance of wood, and not to be mistaken for a <a  href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a> or bend raguly; and its positions should be denoted; if not it should be drawn in pale.</p>
<p class="blazon">We next find <a  href="../b/branch.html">branches</a>(fr. <a  href="../b/branch.html">branches</a>), boughs(fr. rameaux), twigs, sprigs, slips, and the term <a  href="../s/scrogs.html">scrogs</a>: to these terms certain differences are assigned, but the rules laid down are not very rigorously followed. The <a  href="../b/branch.html">branch</a>, if unfructed, should consist of at least three slips, but if with <a  href="../f/fruits.html">fruit</a> then four leaves are sufficient; the <a  href="../s/sprig.html">sprig</a> should have at least five leaves, the slip should have but three. The <a  href="../b/branch.html">branches</a> represented borne in the beaks of doves are no doubt olive branches. Many of the terms noted on the previous page as applied to the <a href="../t/tree.html">tree</a> are also found applied to the <a  href="../b/branch.html">branches</a>, &amp;c. As to staved branches(if the word is not a misreading of starved=withered), it may mean that they are lopped to represent staves.</p>
