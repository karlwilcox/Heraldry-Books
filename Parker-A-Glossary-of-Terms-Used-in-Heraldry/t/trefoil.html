<h1>Trefoil</h1>
<p>Trefoil, (fr. tr&egrave;fle): the term 'iij foils,' i.e. 'trefoils' seems to occur in blazon as early as Edward II.'s reign; but whether the 'three leaves' were conjoined or separate there is no evidence to shew; the term may possibly afterwards have been adopted to represent the clover leaf.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">ordinary</a> form is that shewn in the margin, but it is subject to variations. It is, however, always borne with a stalk, generally ending in a point, when the term <a  href="../s/slipped.html">slipped</a> is used.</p>

<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/586a.png" alt="TURTON." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">TURTON.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="blazon">If however, the stalk is not represented as torn off(which the term <a  href="../s/slipped.html">slipped</a> implies) it must be described as <a  href="../c/couped.html">couped</a>. A <a href="../t/trefoil.html">trefoil</a> doubly slipped would be drawn as the first figure in the margin; but if raguly and couped, as the second figure. With French heralds the tr&egrave;fle is distinguished from the tiercefeuille by the former having a stalk and the latter not.</p>

<p class="blazon">With the <a href="../t/trefoil.html">trefoil</a> may be classed the shamrock, i.e. the three-leaved clover, which is considered the badge of Ireland, being traditionally associated with S.Patrick, who is said to have adopted it as a symbol of the doctrine of the Trinity.</p>
<blockquote>
