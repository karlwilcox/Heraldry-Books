<h1>Tremoile</h1>
<p>Tremoile or Tremaille: this puzzling name occur in an ancient roll, and the copyist in 1562 supposed the bearing to be 'men's <a  href="../h/heart.html">hearts</a>.' It has been thought that they were trefoils, and that both the name and the drawing had been mistaken. Mr.Wyatt Papworth puts them under 'mill-hoppers' (Qy. the wooden troughs belonging to a corn-mill) in noting these arms, but given no reason. The family of TREMAYLE seem to bear three brogues(see under <a  href="../f/foot.html">Foot</a>), but in one blazon they are described as bearing trammels, the meaning of which is doubtful,</p>
