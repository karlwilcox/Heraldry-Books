<h1>Trinity</h1>
<p>Trinity: the symbol of the Holy Trinity in an azure field was the heraldic ensign of the Priory of Black Canons, near Aldgate, in the city of London, called CHRIST CHURCH.</p>
<p class="blazon"><a  href="../s/shield.html">Shield</a> <a  href="../c/charge.html">charged</a> with this device are of frequent occurrence in churches, but they are not to be considered as heraldic in any case except where referring to this monastery, or(perhaps) to that of the Holy Trinity, IPSWICH. A <a  href="../b/banner.html">banner</a> of the Holy Trinity having this device in a red field is recorded to have been borne at Agincourt. An ingenious attempt to blazon the device heraldically has been made, but it is naturally unsatisfactory, and is therefore not given here.</p>
