<h1>Turbot</h1>
<p>Turbot: both the <a href="../t/turbot.html">turbot</a> and the sole are made use of in English heraldry, apparently on account of the name only, as the following examples shew.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three turbots argent, two and one, joined or--TURBUTT, Ogston Hall, co. Derby; [same borne by TURBUTT, co. York; three turbots naiant proper by TARBUTT of Scotland, and three turbots fretted by TARBUTT of Middlesex].</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron gules between three soles haurient[proper] with a bordure engrailed gules--SOLE, Bobbing Place, Kent; also SOLES, Brabanne, co. Cambridge.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, three solefish argent--John de SOLES, Kent.</p>
<p class="blazon">Vert, a chevron between three soles naiant--SOLEY, Shropshire.</p>
<p class="blazon">Per pale or and gules, a chevron counterchanged between three soles azure and argent--SOLEY, Worcestershire.</p>
<p class="blazon">A demi-turbot erect tail upwards is the crest of the family of LAWRENCE, [and so borne by Sir Thomas Lawrence, the celebrated painter].</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">With the above must be grouped the <a  href="../f/flounder.html">flounder</a>, or <a  href="../f/flook.html">flook</a>, as it is called in Scotland, which is probably not to be distinguished from them. Mr.Moule also finds that at Yarmouth this fish is called a butt; in Cornwall he has found the local name to be the carter fish, hence he concludes that the fish borne respectively in the arms of BUTTS and CARTER are meant for a fish of this kind. What the bret fish is, or the birt, he does not seem to have determined. The following examples are taken from his work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a saltire gules between four ermine spots; on a chief of the second three butt fish haurient of the first--BUTTS, Dorking.</p>
<a id="594"></a><p class="blazon">Gules, three flooks(or flounders) argent--ARBUTT.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, a flook argent--FISHER.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, a chevron ermine between three carter fish haurient argent--CARTER, London.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three brets naiant--BRETCOCK.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a birt fish proper--BIRT.</p>
