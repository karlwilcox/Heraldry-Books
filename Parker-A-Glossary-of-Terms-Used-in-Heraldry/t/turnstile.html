<h1>Turnstile</h1>
<p>Turnstile, sometimes called <a href="../t/turnpike.html">turnpike</a>: the charge has been in one case blazoned a <a  href="../r/reel.html">reel</a>, but this is probably an error. Three forms occur, as shewn by the figures in the margin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three turnpikes[elsewhere blazoned turnstiles or reels] sable--WOOLSTON. White.</p>
<p class="blazon">A turnpike or, on a wreath argent and gules--Crest of SKIPWORTH, Linc. (Bart. 1622). Fig. 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/594b.png" alt="3.Turnspike." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">3.Turnspike.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="blazon">Possibly the cross-gate mentioned in the following coat of arms may be of the same character.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a saltire between a cross-gate in chief and another in base and a crescent in each flank gules--HEGENS, Scotland.</p>
