<p>Vane, (1) a Weather-cock, (fr. girouette): this device by itself seems to occur only in one coat of arms; but castles and towers are sometimes <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as bearing vanes, e.g. in the insignia of EDINBURGH. (See under <a  href="../c/castle.html">Castle</a>.) As regards the arms ascribed to a Lord Mayor of London in the twelfth century, they are probably of sixteenth-century invention, though not unlike earlier Merchants' marks. In Stow's Survey the weather-cocks are drawn like the figure in the margin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Gules, on a saltire argent, between four weather-cocks(the supporters and vanes of the second, the cross crosslets or) five martlets of the field--arms ascribed to Henry FITZ-ALWYN, first Mayor of London, and Roger FITZ-ALWYN, his successor.</p>
<p class="blazon">Per fesse sable and azure, a castle with four towers, the gate displayed argent; on each tower a vane or--RAWSON.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a castle with two towers or, embattled and masoned sable, adorned with four vanes argent--CHASTELANI, France. [De gueules, au chateau &agrave; deux tours d'or moconn&eacute; de sable--CASTELLANI, Provence.]</p>
<p class="blazon">D'azur, &agrave; un ch&acirc;teau somm&eacute;, de trois tours, pavillonn&eacute;es et girouett&eacute;es d'argent, le tout ma&ccedil;onn&eacute; de sable--CHASTELAIN DE SERTINES.</p>
