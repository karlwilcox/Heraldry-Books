<h1>Virgin Mary</h1>
<p>Virgin Mary: the figure of the Blessed Virgin Mary occurs in the insignia of one or two Sees(that of LINCOLN has already been given, see <a  href="../n/nimbus.html">Nimbus</a>), and of several religious foundations, and of one or two Scotch Burghs; also on those ascribed to a King of England of the tenth century. It will be seen that the Virgin is variously represented, but always with the <a  href="../i/infant.html">infant</a> <a  href="../s/saviour.html">Saviour</a>.</p>
