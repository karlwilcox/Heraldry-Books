<h1>Virgin</h1>
<p>Virgin: a figure of a saint, when the name is not known, may be thus blazoned, but usually only the head, or the upper portion, is shewn, and the term demi-virgin is used, as in the insignia of the MERCERS' Company. (See under Eastern Crown.) Similar figures are sometimes <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> maidens' <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a>: and those in the insignia of the See of OXFORD, being veiled, are blazoned <a  href="../n/nun.html">nuns'</a> <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a>(sometimes <a  href="../l/ladies-heads.html">ladies' heads</a>). See under <a  href="../h/head.html">Head</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Vert, a demi-virgin couped at the waist proper, mantled gules turned down ermine, her hair dishevelled, on her head an Eastern crown or--Company of PINMAKERS[Inc. 1636].</p>
