<h1>Voided</h1>
<p>Voided, (fr. vid&eacute;): this term applied to <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">ordinaries</a> and subordinaries signifies that the middle is removed so that the field is visible through it; thus a plain chevron voided has the appearance of two couple-closes, and a bend voided that of a pair of cottises. Heralds, however, make some minute distinctions, and these will be found noticed under <a  href="../c/chevron.html">Chevron</a> <a href="../v/voided.html">voided</a>.</p>
<a id="607"></a><p class="blazon">The <a href="../v/voided.html">voiding</a> of certain ordinaries is of ancient practice. It will be observed that the cross 'recercel&eacute;e' is sometimes <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> 'voide' (See  &sect;32). So also 'faux crois' signifies a cross voided(see  &sect;6), while faux lozenge in one roll is used for a <a  href="../m/mascle.html">mascle</a>, though the mascle itself is sometimes found <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> <a href="../v/voided.html">voided</a>. See <a  href="../m/mascle.html">Mascle</a> and Masculy. Again, faux rondelets are found meaning <a  href="../a/annulet.html">annulets</a>, (see under Roundels); and the 'faux escocheon' is now blazoned an <a  href="../o/orle.html">orle</a>. In some cases the term perc&eacute;e, or pierced, is used to mean the same as <a href="../v/voided.html">voided</a>; and in others voided is used of a <a  href="../m/mullet.html">mullet</a> when <a  href="../p/pierced.html">pierced</a> is meant; but as a rule the piercing involves only a small aperture, and generally circular, while voiding involves a larger aperture, and one following the outline of the <a  href="../c/charge.html">charge</a>.</p>
<p class="blazon">When the term is used by itself the tincture of the opening is understood to be that of the field, but an ordinary may be <a href="../v/voided.html">voided</a> of another tincture.</p>
