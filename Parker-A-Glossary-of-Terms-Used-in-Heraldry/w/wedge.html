<h1>Wedge</h1>
<p>Wedge: this is one of the irregular and doubtful term sometimes made use of. The <a  href="../c/charge.html">charges</a> may, after all, in some of the cases be only intended for nails, q.v., but being badly drawn have misled the heralds. Another name given in heraldic books to the same figure is the stone-bill.</p>
