<p>Weel: Fish-weel or Fish-basket is a contrivance still used in rivers to catch fish. The <a  href="../c/charge.html">charges</a> appear to be drawn in various ways, but of those shewn in the margin the first is the more ordinary form of a <a href="../w/weel.html">weel</a>, while the second seems to be usually blazoned a fish-basket. The terms <a  href="../e/eel-pot.html">eel-pots</a>, weir-baskets, occur in describing certain crests, and they have been mistaken for <a  href="../f/flask.html">flasks</a>, <a  href="../j/jars.html">jars</a>, &amp;c., e.g. in the arms of WILLARD.</p>
