<p>Well, (fr. puits): the well with masonry round it, is sometimes borne as <a  href="../f/figured.html">figured</a> in the margin; though the roundle called a <a  href="../f/fountain.html">fountain</a>(q.v.) is an heraldic representation of the same thing, and is accordingly borne by several families in allusion to the meaning. At the same time it is by no means clear always what is meant, as apparently the same <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> are found <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as having in one case fountains, in another wells. A <a  href="../s/stones.html">stone</a> <a  href="../f/fountain.html">fountain</a> appears to be undoubtedly a well. The term <a  href="../c/cold-wells.html">cold well</a> found <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> in the arms of CALDWELL is but an ordinary <a href="../w/well.html">well</a>; and water-houses, in which the <a  href="../d/device.html">devices</a> are probably intended for stone-built conduits.</p>
