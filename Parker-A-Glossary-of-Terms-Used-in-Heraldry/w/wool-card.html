<p>Wool-card: an instrument used for <a  href="../c/combed.html">combing</a> wool, represented as in the margin, and differing, as will be seen, from the wool-comb.</p>
<p class="blazon">It is said that the stock-card is a similar tool used by wool-combers, and is represented as below. The <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazon</a> both of the <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of CARDINGTON and LAYNNE is taken from Glover's <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">Ordinary</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Ermine, three wool-cards gules--ALVERINGE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, three wool-cards[otherwise working-cards], teeth outwards or--CARDINGTON.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three wool-cards sable, the back parts outward--LAYNNE.</p>
