<p>Yard-measure, or Measuring-yard, is only found in one or two examples. It should be drawn sufficiently elongated so as not to be confused with the <a  href="../b/billet.html">billet</a>, since it does not appear to have always the inches marked upon it. In neither of the examples on the Brasses in Cheam Church, Surrey, to ancestors of the YERDE family, are the measures so marked.</p>
