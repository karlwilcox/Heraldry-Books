<p>Yoke, or Double ox-yoke: this device appears variously represented, and two kinds are given in the margin. The first figure is copied from a MS. c. 1580; the second is later. The <a  href="../d/device.html">device</a> is borne but rarely; one instance, that in the arms of PYBERS, where the yoke is made of bamboo, will be found already noted under <a  href="../c/cinnamon.html">Cinnamon</a>, and there are one or two others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three escutcheons gules, in chief a pair of ox-yokes or--HAY.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a yoke sable--NEWTHALL, co. Chester.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a yoke proper and a crescent azure in chief, and in base three escutcheons gules--HAY-DALRYMPLE, co. Wigton.</p>
